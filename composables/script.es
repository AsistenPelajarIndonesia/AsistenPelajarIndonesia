*Socioeconomic status (SES)* is a powerful determinant of health. Across many conditions, individuals in lower SES groups (“poor”) often face higher risks of disease exposure, reduced access to preventive care, and worse outcomes compared to higher‐SES (“rich”) peers. Below is an overview by condition:

---

-> Measles (Cacar)

* *Lower vaccination coverage.*  In low‑ and middle‑income countries, children from the poorest quintiles consistently have lower measles immunization rates than those from the richest.  For example, in Ethiopia (2000–2016), coverage among the poorest rose from 18.2 % to 43.2 %, but still lagged behind the richest (52.1 %→74.2 %) across every survey year ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov][1]).
* *Higher incidence and mortality.*  Unvaccinated children in the poorest households are more than twice as likely to die from measles than those in the wealthiest quintile, as shown in Bangladesh ([immunizationevidence.org][2]).
* *Nuance in high‑income settings.*  In some high‑income countries with pockets of vaccine hesitancy, wealthier districts can paradoxically experience higher measles incidence (e.g., Germany’s least‑deprived districts had 1.58× the measles risk of the most‑deprived) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov][3]).  However, globally, poverty remains the primary driver of under‑immunization and severe outcomes.

-> Chronic Kidney Disease & Kidney Failure

* *Increased prevalence and progression.*  Lower SES (measured by income, education, insurance status) is robustly linked to higher prevalence of CKD and faster progression to end‑stage renal disease (ESRD).  A meta‑analysis found that lower income was associated with a 24 % greater risk of progressing to ESRD and combined low SES with a 39 % higher risk (RR 1.39, 95 % CI 1.09–1.79) ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov][4]).
* *Insurance and access.*  Among high‑risk populations (e.g., diabetes, hypertension), uninsured poor individuals had a 72 % higher probability of ESRD compared with insured counterparts ([bmrat.biomedpress.org][5]).
* *Geographic deprivation.*  In England, the most socioeconomically deprived adults were 68 % more likely to develop advanced CKD than the least deprived, even after adjusting for known risk factors ([georgeinstitute.org.uk][6]).

---

-> Appendicitis

* *Higher incidence & worse outcomes in poverty.*  A statewide study in Washington found that areas in the lowest SES quintile had acute appendicitis incidence of 118.1 per 100 000 PY versus 86.2 per 100 000 PY in the highest SES areas (P < .001) ([jamanetwork.com][7]).
* *Treatment disparities.*  In Taiwan, low‑income patients experienced longer hospital stays and higher case‑fatality ratios after appendectomy compared to non‑poor patients ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov][8]).

---

-> Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DBD)

* *Environmental & infrastructural factors.*  Poor neighborhoods, with inadequate water/sanitation and higher unemployment, consistently show higher dengue incidence.  In Nouméa (New Caledonia), dengue incidence was positively associated with higher unemployment (IRR 1.25) and lower revenue ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov][9]).
* *Global patterns.*  In Pakistan’s Faisalabad, dengue seroprevalence was 45 % in the most socioeconomically vulnerable class versus 16 % in the most privileged ([scielo.br][10]).  Similar links between low SES and dengue risk have been documented in Brazil and Brazil’s Várzea Paulista ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov][11]).

---

-> Chickenpox (Varicella)

* *Lower vaccine uptake in low‑income groups.*  In settings without universal varicella immunization, out‑of‑pocket cost is a major barrier.  In Greater Tokyo’s Chiba City (no subsidy), children from households earning ≥ ¥8 million were *6.55×* more likely to be vaccinated than those earning < ¥4 million (95 % CI 2.14–20.1).  Once a partial subsidy was introduced in neighboring Nishitokyo, that income disparity disappeared ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov][12]).
* *Strong link with local wealth.*  In a multi‑county survey across eastern, middle, and western China, first‑dose varicella coverage ranged from \~ 60 % in poorer counties to \~ 80 % in wealthier ones, with coverage correlating almost perfectly with per‑capita GDP (r = 0.929, P < 0.01) ([oncotarget.com][13]).
* *Implication for incidence & severity.*  Lower vaccination rates leave larger susceptible pools, driving outbreaks in under‑resourced communities and increasing hospitalizations for complications (e.g., bacterial superinfection, pneumonia).  Although exact incidence gaps vary by locale, the pattern—poor → under‑vaccinated → higher disease burden—holds across diverse settings.

*Bottom line:*

* *Yes*, in most settings poor people are *more likely* to contract measles (due to under‑vaccination), develop and progress to kidney failure (due to poorer access and higher comorbidity), suffer appendicitis more frequently (and with worse outcomes), and incur dengue hemorrhagic fever (due to environmental vulnerability), compared to their rich counterparts.
* *Exceptions:*  In some high‑income regions, vaccine hesitancy among affluent groups can temporarily invert patterns for measles.

*Addressing these disparities* requires improving access to vaccines and primary care, ensuring financial protection (e.g. insurance), upgrading housing and sanitation, and targeted public‑health outreach in deprived communities.
