Okay, I need to evaluate these 10 questions based on the specified parameters for the SNBT exam. First, I'll check each question against each parameter. Let's start with the first question about the car's fuel consumption. The question is clear, so kejelasan_konsep_kuantitatif is high. The math here is straightforward, so maybe the complexity is low. Then, the second question about company employees: the percentage increase calculation. The explanation here is correct, but maybe the options could be clearer. Wait, looking at parameter 3, akurasi_fakta_dan_istilah. For question 4, the ratio part, the explanation says "total pemain" but mentions the total is 11, but the question says 11, then subtracting 2 makes 9, so the ratio is 2/11? But the correct answer given is 2/9. That's a mistake! So that's an accuracy issue. Similarly, question 7's explanation says 3/15 simplifies to 1/5, which is correct. Wait, but the correct answer was option b which is 3/15, which is correct. But in question 4, the correct answer is b (2/9) but the explanation says the ratio is 2/11 vs 2/9. That's conflicting. So the explanation might have an error there. So that's an error in the answer's validity. 

Moving to the other parameters like relevansi_kurikulum. Since all topics are basic math, they should align with the curriculum. The questions seem to cover arithmetic, percentages, ratios, profit calculations, which are standard. 

For originalitas_soal, some questions seem similar, like the fuel efficiency and similar percentage increase, so maybe they're not very original. 

Kompleksitas_kognitif: Most questions are straightforward calculations, so maybe low to medium. 

Kemampuan_diskriminasi: The distractors are okay but maybe some options are too obvious. 

So for each parameter, I need to check each question and aggregate the scores. But the user wants each question evaluated per parameter, but the input was a set of questions. Wait, the user's instruction was to evaluate the provided text (which is the entire JSON of questions) based on the parameters. The user's input is the entire set of questions. So, the assessment is for the whole set.

Let me go parameter by parameter.

1. kejelasan_konsep_kuantitatif: Most questions clearly state the concept. However, question 4's explanation has an error. The correct answer's explanation says the ratio is 2/11, but the correct answer given is 2/9 (option b). 2/9?), which might be a mistake. Wait the question 4's correct answer is b (2/9), but according to the question description: the team has 11 players, 2 injured. The ratio of injured to total players is 2/11, but the question says "rasio pemain yang cedera terhadap total pemain adalah...", so the correct answer should be 2/11, but the correct answer listed is option b (2/9). Wait, looking at the question again: 

Question pu_q4's question says "rasio pemain yang cedera terhadap total pemain" (ratio of injured players to total players). The initial players are 11, 2 injured, so 2/11. But the correct answer given is option b (2/9). That's an error. So the correct answer is wrong here. That's a big problem. So the accuracy is wrong here, so the akurasi_fakta_dan_istilah would be low here. So that's a critical error.

Similarly, in question 7: "Sebuah tim sepak bola memiliki 15 pemain. Jika 3 pemain cedera..., then the ratio is 3/15 (option b), which is correct. The explanation there is correct. 

So for parameter akurasi_fakta_dan_istilah, there's an error in question 4's correct answer. So that's a problem, so the grade there would be lower because of that mistake. 

Another example: question 8's answer explanation says the final price after 3 years for 15% increase on 80,000. Let's compute: 80,000 *1.15^3. First year 80,000 *1.15 =92,000. Second year 92,000*1.15= 105,800. Third year: 105,800*1.15=121,670. The answer given is a (121,000), which is rounded, but the options have 121,000, so that's acceptable. 

Now, checking all parameters:

Overall, most questions are accurate except question 4's correct answer. 

For kejelasan_konsep_kuantitatif: Most questions are clear, but question 4's answer is incorrect, so maybe that parameter would have an issue. Wait, but kejelasan is about how clear the concept is presented, not the answer's correctness. The question's phrasing is clear, but the answer is wrong. So accuracy parameter is where that error would count. 

So for each parameter:

1. kejelasan_konsep_kuantitatif: The concepts (like percentage increase, ratios, profit calculation) are clearly presented in most questions. Only question 4's explanation might confuse, but the question itself is clear. Maybe 90/100.

2. kedalaman_pengetahuan: Most are basic calculations (remembering formulas), so maybe moderate depth. Maybe 60.

3. akurasi_fakta_dan_istilah: The error in question 4's answer (the ratio) is a factual error. The correct answer should be 2/11 but the correct answer is marked as 2/9 (option b). So that's an inaccuracy. So this would lower the accuracy grade. Maybe 85 because one question is wrong. 

4. koreksi_isi_dan_validitas: The error in question 4 makes this invalid. So validity is compromised. Maybe 80.

5. relevansi_kurikulum: These are basic math topics, so they should align. Maybe 95.

6. kompleksitas_kognitif: Mostly straightforward, so low to medium. Maybe 50.

7. kemampuan_diskriminasi: Distractors are okay but not very tricky. Maybe 60.

8. originalitas_soal: Some questions are similar to each other (like percentage increase in questions 2 and 7). So originality is low. Maybe 40.

9. kejelasan_instruksi: The questions are clear, instructions are explicit. 90.

Wait but the user's parameters are to be applied to the entire set. The user provided the questions and wants each parameter evaluated. 

But also, in question 4's case, the correct answer is marked as option b (2/9), which is incorrect. The correct ratio is 2/11. So this is a factual error. That's a major issue for akurasi_fakta. 

Similarly, question pu_q7: the question says "rasio pemain yang cedera terhadap total pemain" which is 3/15, so correct answer is b (3/15). So that's okay. 

Other questions seem accurate. So the main issue is question4. 

Another possible issue: in question 7's explanation says "4/20 x100 =20% but the correct answer is c (25%?), but looking at question pu_q7: the question is pu_q7 is not part of the first 10. Wait the user's input has 10 questions, but in the provided JSON, the first 10 are pu_q1 to pu_q10? Wait the user's JSON has 10 questions, but in the JSON provided, the last question is pu_q10. Looking at the JSON, in question pu_q4: the correct answer is b (2/9). But the correct ratio is 2/11. So that's a factual error. 

So for akurasi_fakta_dan_istilah: there's a critical error in question 4. So the accuracy is compromised. Maybe a grade like 80 because only one question has an error, but it's a critical one.

Overall, I need to assign a numerical grade (1-100) for each parameter. Let me go through each parameter:

1. **kejelas_konsep_kuantitatif**: Concepts are clear in most questions. The concepts are well-defined except maybe question4's answer. But the question's phrasing is clear. So maybe 85/100.

2. **kedalaman_pengetahuan**: Most questions are surface level (remembering formulas, direct calculation). So maybe 40/100.

3. **akurasi_fakta_dan_istilah**: The error in question4's correct answer (2/9 vs actual 2/11), so that's a factual error. Maybe grade around 85 (since 1 out of 10 questions has an error).

4. **koreksi_isi_dan_validitas**: The error in question4 makes it invalid. So maybe 70 because one question is invalid.

5. **relevansi_kurikulum**: All topics are within basic math, so 100.

6. **kompleksitas_kognitif**: Most are low, maybe 40.

7. **kemampuan_diskriminasi**: Distractors are okay but not very tricky. Maybe 60.

8. **originalitas_soal**: Some repetition (multiple percentage questions, ratio questions), so maybe 40.

9. **kejelasan_instruksi**: Instructions are clear, 95.

Now compiling these into the JSON. The user wants the overall_grade as well. The overall grade would be an average or based on critical issues. Since there's a factual error in question4, that's a major flaw, so the overall grade might be lower. Let me list each parameter's grade and feedback.

Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a set of 20 questions for the SNBT exam's General Reasoning section and wants them evaluated based on specific parameters. First, I need to recall the parameters outlined in the instructions. The parameters are tingkat_induktifitas, kompleksitas_pola, keragaman_tipe_stimulus, tingkat_kognitif_analisis, kejelasan_instruksi, koreksi_isi_dan_validitas, kemampuan_diskriminasi, originalitas_soal, and keterkaitan_dengan_konteks_uji. 

Hmm, looking at the questions provided, they are all multiple-choice questions asking for factual information. The parameters mentioned are for Penalaran Umum (General Reasoning), which typically involves inductive reasoning, pattern recognition, etc. But these questions are more about knowledge recall rather than reasoning. 

Starting with tingkat_induktifitas: Since these are factual recall questions, there's no inductive reasoning required. The user just needs to remember the correct fact. So the inductive level is very low. Maybe a score of 0 or 10 out of 100? Wait, the parameter says it should require inductive reasoning from examples to generalization. These questions don't do that. So probably a low score here.

Next, kompleksitas_pola: The questions don't involve patterns. They are straightforward facts. So again, low complexity. Maybe 0 or 10.

Keragaman_tipe_stimulus: The questions are all text-based, no images or different formats. The stimuli are all textual and similar in type. So low diversity. Maybe around 20?

Tingkat_kognitif_analisis: These questions don't require analysis, just recall. So maybe 0 or 10.

Kejelasan_instruksi: The instructions are clear, like "Who is the author of...", so clarity is high here. Maybe 90 or 100?

Koreksi_isi_dan_validitas: The questions seem accurate. For example, the author of 'Laskar Pelangi' is indeed Andrea Hirata, and the capital of Canada is Ottawa. So validity is high. Maybe 100?

Kemampuan_diskriminasi: Since they are knowledge-based, they might not discriminate well between those who can reason and guessers. So maybe low, like 20.

Originalitas_soal: Many of these are common knowledge questions. For example, the author of 'Laskar Pelangi' is a well-known fact. So originality is low, maybe 20.

Keterkaitan_dengan_konteks_uji: The SNBT exam does have these types of questions, so they fit the context. Maybe 100.

Wait, but the parameters are for Penalaran Umum (General Reasoning), but these questions are more about Pengetahuan Umum (General Knowledge). So there might be a mismatch. The user mentioned "Penalaran Umum (Penalaran Induktif)" which is inductive reasoning. These questions don't involve that. So perhaps the parameter keterkaitan_dengan_konteks_uji would be low because they are not aligned with the reasoning aspect. Wait, but the user's instruction says "Penalaran Umum (Penalaran Induktif)" which is inductive reasoning, but the questions provided are factual. So maybe the keterkaitan is low here. 

Wait, the user's parameters are specifically for evaluating the questions in terms of being suitable for the SNBT's Penalaran Umum (Inductive Reasoning) section. But the given questions are not about inductive reasoning but factual knowledge. So for the 'keterkaitan_dengan_konteks_uji', if the exam's Penalaran Umum requires inductive reasoning, then these questions are not aligned, so maybe a low score here? But the user is asking to evaluate the questions as if they were for Penalaran Umum. Hmm, perhaps the user might have mixed up the sections. 

Alternatively, maybe the SNBT's Penalaran Umum includes factual knowledge? Not sure. But according to the parameters, the questions need to assess inductive reasoning. Since they don't, the keterkaitan might be low. 

But to follow the parameters strictly: The questions are fact-based, so for example, tingkat_induktifitas is about requiring inductive reasoning, which these don't have. So each parameter needs to be assessed accordingly.

Let me go through each parameter one by one:

1. **tingkat_induktifitas**: All questions are factual recall. No inductive reasoning required. Score: 0/100.

2. **kompleksitas_pola**: No patterns to identify here. Answers are direct facts. So 0 or 10.

3. **keragaman_tipe_stimulus**: All questions are text-based, same format. Very low diversity. Maybe 10.

4. **tingkat_kognitif_analisis**: No analysis needed, just recall. 0.

5. **kejelasan_instruksi**: Instructions are clear. Each question is straightforward. Maybe 95.

6. **koreksi_isi_dan_validitas**: The content is correct, but some might have issues. For example, question 19 says "president keempat" as Abdurrahman Wahid, which is correct. However, the explanation for ppu_q15 says B.J. Habibie is the third president, but actually, Suharto was the second, Habibie was the third (1998-1999), then Wahid (4th). Wait, looking at question 19: it's asking for the fourth president, which is correct. So content is valid. So maybe 100.

7. **kemampuan_diskriminasi**: Since they're knowledge questions, they might not discriminate well between inductive thinkers and guessers. So low, like 20.

8. **originalitas_soal**: These are standard questions. Not original, so maybe 20.

9. **keterkaitan_dengan_konteks_uji**: If the exam's Penalaran Umum requires inductive reasoning, these are not aligned. So maybe 30? Or lower. Since they are Pengetahuan (knowledge) vs Penalaran (reasoning). So maybe 0 or very low. But the user might have mixed up the sections. The user says "PPU" which is Pengetahuan & Pemahaman Umum, so maybe the context is correct for their own section, but according to the parameters given for Penalaran Umum, which requires inductive reasoning, these questions are misaligned. So the parameter 'keterkaitan' would be low. Let's say 20.

Wait, the parameters mention that the questions should align with the official SNBT format for General Reasoning (Penalaran Umum). Since these are knowledge-based, they don't fit the reasoning section. So the 'keterkaitan_dengan_konteks_uji' would be low. Maybe 20/100.

Putting it all together:

- tingkat_induktifitas: 0 (no inductive reasoning needed)
- kompleksitas_pola: 10 (no patterns)
- keragaman_tipe_stimulus: 10 (all text)
- tingkat_kognitif_analisis: 0 (no analysis needed)
- kejelasan_instruksi: 100 (clear instructions)
- koreksi_isi_dan_validitas: 100 (content is correct)
- kemampuan_diskriminasi: 20 (can't tell between reasoners and guessers)
- originalitas_soal: 20 (common facts, not original)
- keterkaitan_dengan_konteks_uji: 20 (not aligned with inductive reasoning, but maybe if the context is Pengetahuan Umum, but the parameters are for Penalaran. So 20.

Overall grade: Maybe 20? But need to calculate each parameter's grade as per the parameters.

Wait, the parameters are for Penalaran Umum (Inductive Reasoning), so the questions provided are not matching the required reasoning aspects. Therefore, their effectiveness in terms of the parameters would be low except for clarity and validity. 

But the user might have made a mistake in the section (PPU vs Penalaran). But according to the parameters, the questions are evaluated based on how well they fit the inductive reasoning criteria. Since they don't, most parameters would be low except clarity and validity.

So compiling the JSON with each parameter's scores as per the criteria.

Okay, let's tackle this. The user provided a set of 10 questions for the SNBT exam, specifically in Penalaran Umum (Deductive Reasoning). My job is to evaluate these questions based on the specified parameters. The user wants a JSON output with the parameters, grades, and feedback.

First, I need to go through each parameter one by one. Let's start with the parameters listed. Since the user provided a JSON of questions, I need to check each question against each parameter. But since the instruction says to evaluate the entire text (the questions as a whole), I should assess the set as a whole rather than each question individually.

Looking at the first parameter: tingkat_kesulitan_kuantitatif. This measures the complexity of quantitative calculations. Since these are deductive logic questions, they don't involve complex math operations. So maybe a low score here.

Next, kejelasan_data_dan_informasi. The questions are straightforward. The premises and conclusions are clear, so maybe high clarity.

Keragaman_konsep_matematis: These are all logic-based, so they don't cover diverse math topics. Maybe low here.

Kompleksitas_operasi: The operations here are logical deductions rather than mathematical operations. So perhaps low.

Kemampuan_analisis_strategi: The questions require applying logical rules, which does involve strategy. Maybe moderate to high.

Keakuratan_konteks_realistis: The contexts are simple and realistic (like studying for exams, everyday scenarios). So high accuracy.

Koreksi_isi_dan_validitas: Need to check for errors. The questions seem logically correct. No obvious errors, so high score.

Kemampuan_diskriminasi: The questions test understanding of logic, so they should distinguish between those who know and don't. High.

Kesesuaian_notasi_dan_simbol: Since it's logic, symbols like ~ are used. They are standard, so high.

Originalitas_soal: All the questions are standard syllogism types. They’re common, so low originality.

Wait, but the user's input is in Indonesian, so I need to ensure that the parameters are applied correctly. Let me check each parameter again.

Looking at kesesuaian_standar_uji: The question types (syllogism, equivalence) match the standard SNBT format? Since they’re using standard question types like syllogism and equivalence, which are typical in logic exams, so probably high.

Originalitas_soal: The questions are typical and not very original. They follow common patterns, so maybe a low score here.

Now, for each parameter, assign a grade from 1-100. Let me go step by step.

1. tingkat_kesulitan_kuantitatif: Since it's logic, not math-heavy. Maybe 10/100 because there's almost no quantitative complexity.

2. kejelasan_data_dan_informasi: The questions are clear, data is explicit. Maybe 95/100.

3. keragaman_konsep_matematis: All are logic-based, so lack of math diversity. 20/100.

4. kompleksitas_operasi: The operations are logical steps, but not complex. Maybe 30/100? Or maybe higher since they require applying logical steps.

Hmm, maybe 50? Not sure yet.

Wait, the parameter for kompleksitas_operasi refers to mathematical operations. Since these are logic problems, perhaps this is low. So maybe 20.

5. kemampuan_analisis_strategi: They require understanding syllogism structure, so requires some strategy. Maybe 80/100.

6. keakuratan_konteks_realistis: The contexts are simple and realistic (like library books, students, etc.), so 90/100.

7. koreksi_isi_dan_validitas: No errors detected, so 100/100.

8. kemampuan_diskriminasi: The distractors are plausible but the correct answers are distinct, so high. Maybe 85/100.

9. kesesuaian_notasi_dan_simbol: They use ~ for negation, which is standard. So 100/100.

10. originalitas_soal: The questions are standard types (syllogism, equivalence), so low originality. Maybe 30/100.

11. kesesuaian_standar_uji: The question types (syllogism, equivalence) are standard for SNBT's logical reasoning section. So 95/100.

Wait, the user's parameters include kesesuaian_standar_uji, which checks if the question format matches SNBT standards. Since these are syllogism and equivalence, which are standard in such exams, that's probably high.

Now, compiling these into the JSON. The user also requires an overall_grade. The overall would be an average or a composite, but the example just has an overall_grade. The example shows a numerical value. Let's calculate the average of the parameters given.

Wait, but the user's instruction says to provide a grade for each parameter they specify. Wait, actually, the user's initial message says: when given an input, analyze the text according to the specified parameter. But in the user's input, the instruction was to review the questions, so the parameters are all those listed in the parameters, but the user may have specified which parameters to use. Wait, actually, the user's instruction says "berikut beberapa parameter khusus" (below are specific parameters). The user says, when given the text (the questions), evaluate according to the specified parameter. Wait, but the user didn't specify which parameters to use. Wait, looking back at the user's input:

The user provided the questions and said "Review: ...", and the engine's job is to evaluate the questions based on the parameters listed. The engine needs to choose which parameters to apply. Wait, no, the user didn't specify which parameters to use. Wait, the initial instruction says "when given an input, follow these steps precisely: 1. parse the user's instruction payload, which includes 'text' (the text to evaluate). The parameters are the list provided. But the user might have to specify which parameter to evaluate. Wait, no, the user's original instruction says "when given an input, follow steps: 1. parse user's instruction payload, which includes 'text'. The parameter is part of the instruction. Wait, the user's instruction says "when given an input, follow these steps precisely: 1. parse the users instruction payload, which will include "text": the text to evaluate (string). Then analyze the text according to the specified parameter. Wait, but in the user's current message, the instruction is to review the questions, but the parameters are the ones listed in the initial parameters. The user probably wants all parameters to be evaluated, but according to the problem's setup, the user's input may have a parameter specified. Wait, looking back at the user's message, the user's input is the JSON questions. The parameters to evaluate must be all the parameters listed? Or is the user expecting an overall assessment across all parameters?

Wait, the user's instruction says that when given an input (the text), analyze according to the specified parameter. But in this case, the user wants to evaluate the set of questions across all the parameters provided. But the engine must choose which parameters to apply. Wait, the user might not have specified a particular parameter, so perhaps the engine should evaluate all applicable parameters. But the example given in the initial instructions shows that the user can specify which parameters to use. But in this case, since the user provided the entire set of questions and wants a review, perhaps the engine is to evaluate all parameters applicable to the questions.

Alternatively, perhaps the user expects the engine to evaluate each parameter for the given questions. But the problem is the user's instruction says to pick the parameter from the list, but the user's current input (the review request) doesn't specify which parameter. Wait, looking at the user's message, the user says "Review: Berikut beberapa parameter khusus..." which is part of the instructions. The user's actual input is the JSON questions, and the task is to evaluate them according to the parameters listed. The user is asking for an assessment using the parameters, so all applicable parameters should be evaluated. But the output requires the JSON with parameters as keys. Since the user provided all parameters, but the questions are about logic, some parameters may not apply. For example, tingkat_kesulitan_kuantitatif is about quantitative complexity. Since these are logic questions, that parameter's score would be low, but the question's other parameters like kesesuaian_standar_uji might be high.

Wait, the user's instruction says "when given an input, follow these steps precisely: 1. parse the user's instruction payload, which includes 'text': the text to evaluate." The user provided the questions as the text. The parameters are the ones listed, so the evaluator should apply each parameter to the text (the questions) and assign each a grade.

Therefore, I need to evaluate all parameters for the given questions. Let's go through each parameter one by one.

1. tingkat_kesulitan_kuantitatif: The questions are logic-based, not requiring numerical calculations. So low. Maybe 10/100.

2. kejelasan_data_dan_informasi: The questions are clear, data is presented without ambiguity. 90/100.

3. keragam konsep matematis: These are all logic concepts, so not diverse in math topics. Maybe 20/100.

4. kompleksitas_operasi: The operations are logical steps, not math operations. So maybe 20/100.

5. kemampuan_analisis_strategi: They require applying syllogism rules, which is strategic. Maybe 85/100.

6. keakuratan konteks: The contexts are realistic (like exams, books in library), so 95/100.

7. koreksi_isi_dan_validitas: All questions have correct answers and no inconsistencies. 100/100.

8. kemampuan_diskriminasi: The distractors are plausible but correct answer is clear. Maybe 85/100.

9. kesesuaian_notasi_dan_simbol: Uses ~ for negation, which is standard. 95/100.

10. originalitas_soal: The questions are typical syllogism types, not original. 20/100.

11. kesesuaian_standar_uji: The format matches SNBT's logical reasoning questions, so 100/100.

Wait, but the parameters are in the list, and the user's input is the set of questions. Each parameter's grade must be evaluated.

Wait, also, the user's example output includes parameters like "overall_grade" which is required. Wait, the example shows "overall_grade" as a field. The user's final instruction says "Always respond with a well-formed JSON object containing those four keys: parameter (the parameter name), grade, etc. Wait, no, looking back, the example given by the user's initial message shows the JSON output has parameters as keys. The example shows:

{
  "parameter1": "34",
  "parameter2": "22",
  ...
  "overall_grade": "...",
  "feedback": "..."
}

Wait, the user's instruction says to produce a JSON object with the parameters as keys, each with their grade, and then an overall_grade and feedback. Wait, no, the example in the user's instruction shows that the JSON has keys like "parameter1": "34", "parameter2": "22", etc., but the user's actual instruction says:

"Produce exactly one JSON object with the following fields: 'parameter' (the parameter's key), 'grade', 'feedback'. Wait, no, looking again: the example given in the user's initial message's example is:

{
"parameter1": "34",
"parameter2": "22",
"parameter3": "98",
"overall_grade": "95",
"feedback": "..."
}

So the parameters are individual keys. Each parameter (like "tingkat_kesulitan_kuantitatif") would be a key in the JSON. Wait, but the user might have intended to select one parameter each time. But the user's current request is to evaluate the questions against all applicable parameters. But the example shows multiple parameters in the JSON output. So the engine needs to evaluate each parameter from the list provided and output each parameter's grade.

Wait, but how many parameters are there? The user listed 11 parameters. The user's instruction says when given the text (the questions), which are in the input), the engine must analyze the text according to the specified parameter. Wait, the problem is that the user's instruction says when given an input, the user must specify a parameter. But in this case, the user provided the questions and the instructions include the parameters, but the user didn't specify which parameters to evaluate. Wait, the user's initial instructions say: "When given an input, follow these steps precisely: 1. parse the user's instruction payload, which includes 'text': the text to evaluate. 2. Analyze the text according to the specified parameter. Generate a grade based on that parameter."

Wait, but the user's current input's instruction is to review the questions using the parameters. The user's instruction in the current query is "Review: Berikut adalah 10 soal...". The user didn't specify a parameter, so perhaps the engine needs to evaluate all parameters. But the initial instruction says the user's input must include the parameter. However, in this case, the user hasn't specified a particular parameter, so the engine should return null for all parameters and feedback that the parameter isn't specified. Wait, but the user's instruction says that if any required field is missing, return "grade": null and feedback explaining missing fields. Wait, the required fields in the input are "text". The user provided the text (the questions). So, perhaps the user expects that the evaluation is done against all parameters. But the initial instruction says "analyze the text according to the specified parameter." Wait, the problem is ambiguous here. The user's instruction says that the user must specify which parameter to evaluate. But in the current case, the user provided the questions but didn't specify which parameter. Wait, looking at the user's instruction's example: the user's example input would have specified the parameter. In this case, the user's input (the review request) includes the questions but perhaps didn't specify which parameters to evaluate. So maybe the user expects evaluating all parameters applicable to the questions.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants to evaluate all parameters and report each, along with an overall grade.

Alternatively, perhaps the user's instruction might have a mistake here, but I need to proceed with the assumption that the user wants to evaluate all the parameters provided and return each with their grades.

Therefore, I need to assign each parameter a grade and feedback based on the questions.

Now, proceeding step by step for each parameter.

1. tingkat_kesulitan_kuantitatif: Since the questions are deductive logic (syllogism, not math), quantitative difficulty is low. Grade: 10/100.

Feedback: The questions are purely logical, requiring no numerical calculations, so quantitative difficulty minimal.

2. kejelasan_data_dan_informasi: The questions are clear, data is explicit. 90/100. Feedback: Questions present clear premises and options without ambiguity.

3. keragam konsep matematis: Only logic concepts, so lack of diversity. 20/100.

Feedback: The questions focus solely on deductive logic, not coveringing various math topics.

4. kompleksitas_operasi: The operations are logical steps (modus ponens, etc.), but math operations are none. Since the parameter refers to mathematical operations, this would score low. 15/100.

Feedback: Questions require logical deductions not mathematical operations, so complexity minimal.

5. kemampuan_analisis_strategi: They require applying syllogism rules correctly. Strategy needed. 80/100.

Feedback: Requires strategic application of logical rules to arrive at correct conclusions.

6. keakuratan_konteks_realistis: Contexts are typical (students, books, weather examples), so accurate and relevant. 95/100.

Feedback: Contexts are realistic and contextually appropriate without numerical inconsistencies.

7. koreksi_isi_dan_validitas: All questions seem valid, no errors. 100/100.

Feedback: No inconsistencies or errors detected in the questions.

8. kemampuan_diskriminasi: Distractors are plausible. Correct answers require understanding, so discriminative. 85/100.

Feedback: Distractors are relevant but the correct answers require understanding logical structures.

9. kesesuaian_notasi_dan_simbol: Uses standard notation like ~ for negation. 95/100.

Feedback: Uses standard logical symbols correctly.

10. originalitas_soal: The questions are standard types (syllogism, equivalence), etc.), so low originality. 20/100.

Feedback: Questions follow common logical reasoning patterns without novel scenarios.

11. kesesuaian_standar_uji: The questions match syllogism and equivalence types common in SNBT. 95/100.

Feedback: The question formats align with SNBT's deductive reasoning standards.

Now, the overall_grade would be an average of all parameters. Let's calculate:

Compute all scores:

1. 10  
2.90  
3.20  
4.15  
5.80  
6.95  
7.100  
8.85  
9.95  
10.20  
11.95  
Total: 10+90=100; +20=120; +15=135; +80=215; +95=310; +100=410; +85=495; +95=590; +20=610; +95=705. Total of 11 parameters. 705/11 = ~64.09. Let's round to 64.

But the example shows an overall_grade as a single value. So the overall_grade is an average or summary.

Alternatively, the user might expect an overall grade, but perhaps the feedback can summarize.

Now compiling the JSON with each parameter and their grades, plus the overall and feedback.

But the user's instruction says the JSON must have the four keys: but in the example, the keys are parameter1, etc., but the correct format is each parameter as a key. Wait, the example shows parameters as keys like "parameter1": "34", but perhaps the correct structure is that each parameter is a key in the JSON. Wait, the user's example shows:

{
"parameter1": "34",
"parameter2": "22",
"parameter3": "98",
"overall_grade": "95",
"feedback": "..."
}

So the JSON should have all the parameters that apply, each as a key, plus the overall_grade and feedback. Wait, but the user's instruction says "produce exactly one JSON object with four keys: the parameter's name, grade, feedback, and overall_grade. Wait, no, the example shows multiple parameters as keys. Wait the user's instruction says "produce exactly one JSON object with those four keys: parameter, grade, feedback, and overall_grade?" No, the example shows that the JSON has multiple parameters as keys, each with their grade, plus an overall_grade and feedback. Wait the user's example shows:

The example given by the user has "parameter1" etc. But the user's instruction says to produce a JSON with "parameter", "grade", "feedback", but the example shows multiple parameters. Wait, the user's instructions might have a typo, but the example shows that the JSON output can have multiple parameters as keys. The user's instruction says "the JSON must have the following fields": but the example shows multiple parameters as keys. Therefore, the correct structure is a JSON object where each key is a parameter from the list, with their grades, plus the overall_grade and feedback.

Wait, the example's JSON has "parameter1", "parameter2", etc., implying that the keys are the parameter names. So each parameter from the list should be a key in the JSON, each with their grade. Then, the overall_grade and feedback are also included. Wait, but the example's example has "overall_grade" and feedback. So the JSON should have all parameters (each parameter as a key with their grade), plus overall_grade and feedback.

Wait, the user's instruction says: "Produce exactly one JSON object containing those four keys: parameter, grade, feedback, and overall_grade." Wait, no, the example shows multiple parameters as keys. The user's instruction says:

The example given by the user shows:

{
  "parameter1": "34",
  "parameter2": "22",
  "parameter3": "98",
  "overall_grade": "95",
  "feedback": "..."
}

So the required keys are each parameter name (like "tingkat_kesulitan_kuantitatif"), and also "overall_grade" and "feedback". Wait, but the user's instruction says "the four keys" but the example has parameters plus overall and feedback. The user's instruction says "produce exactly one JSON object with those four keys: the parameter, grade, feedback, and overall_grade?" Hmm, maybe the user expects the JSON to have each parameter as a key with their grade, plus an overall_grade and feedback.

Alternatively, perhaps each parameter is evaluated, but the user might have intended to pick one parameter per evaluation. But since the user provided a set of questions, perhaps the user wants all parameters evaluated.

Therefore, the JSON will have each of the 11 parameters as keys, each with their grade, plus the overall_grade and feedback. But the user's example shows multiple parameter keys plus the two others. So I need to include all parameters that are applicable, but some may not apply. For example, kesesuaian_notasi_dan_simbol: since the questions use ~ for negation which is standard, so yes.

Wait, but the user's instruction says to produce a JSON with the fields: each parameter's key, their grade, and then an overall_grade and feedback. But the example shows parameters as keys, and then overall and feedback. So I need to include all parameters as keys, their grades, then overall grade and feedback.

So the JSON will have entries for each parameter (like "tingkat_kesulitan_kuantitatif": "10", etc.), plus "overall_grade": "64" (the average), and feedback explaining the overall assessment.

But the user's instruction says "the JSON must have exactly one JSON object with those four keys". Wait, maybe I misunderstood. Looking back, the user's example shows that the JSON has parameter keys plus the overall and feedback. The instruction says the JSON must have fields like parameter1, etc., but the user's instruction says "the JSON must contain those four keys: parameter, grade, feedback, and overall_grade". Wait, no, the example shows multiple parameters. The user's instruction says "the JSON must contain those four keys" — but perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. Alternatively, maybe each parameter is a separate entry, and the overall_grade and feedback are also present. So the JSON would have all the parameters as keys with their grades, plus the overall_grade and feedback.

Thus, proceeding with that structure.

Now compiling all the grades:

Parameters and their grades:

"tingkat_kesulitan_kuantitatif": 10,

"kejelasan_data_dan_informasi": 90,

"keragam_konsep_matematis": 20,

"kemoleksitas_operasi": 15,

"kemampuan_analisis_strategi": 80,

"keakurat_konteks_realistis": 95,

"koreksi_isi_dan_validitas": 100,

"kemampuan_diskriminasi": 85,

"kesesuaian_notasi_dan_simbol": 95,

"originalitas_soal": 20,

"kesesuaian_standar_uji": 95,

"overall_grade": "64" (average of all 11 parameters: sum is 10+90+20+15+80+95+100+85+95+20+95 = let's sum:

10 +90=100; +20=120; +15=135; +80=215; +95=310; +100=410; +85=495; +95=590; +20=610; +95=705. Total 705 over 11 parameters: 705 /11 ≈64.09 → 64.

Feedback for overall: Overall, the questions are well-structured with clear logic but lack mathematical diversity and originality.

Wait, but the parameters' names must be in Indonesian as listed in the parameters. Let me ensure the parameter names are correctly spelled as in the user's parameters.

The parameters are:

The user listed the parameters as:

"tingkat_kesulitan_kuantitatif"

"kejelasan_data_dan_informasi" (maybe typo in original? The user's parameter list has "kejelasan_data_dan_informasi" (without 'a' in the second 'kejelasan'? Let me check the user's original list:

The user's parameters are listed as:

- **tingkat_kesulitan_kuantitatif**: ...  
- kejelasan_data_dan_informasi: ...  
- keragam_konsep_matematis (maybe "keragaman_konsep_matematis" but in the user's input:

The user's parameter list says:

- keragam_konsep_matematis (maybe keragaman_konsep_matematis? The user's parameter names may have typos. Need to match exactly as listed in the user's parameters. Let me check the exact names as provided in the problem's parameters:

The user's parameters (the list under "parameter khusus"):

The parameters are:

1. tingkat_kesulitan_kuantitatif  
2. kejelasan_data_dan informasi  
3. keragam_konsep_matematis  
4. kompleksitas_operasi  
5. kemampuan_analisis_strategi  
6. keakurat_konteks_realistis  
7. koreksi_isi_dan_validitas  
8. kemampuan_diskriminasi  
9. kesesuaian_notasi_dan_simbol  
10. originalitas_soal  
11. kesesuaian_standar_uji  

Wait, the parameters are written in the user's initial message with typos? For example, "kejelasan_data_dan informasi" may actually be "kejelasan_data_dan_informasi".

But I need to use exactly the parameter names as listed in the user's parameter list. Let me check:

The user's parameter list:

Looking back, the parameters are:

The user listed them as:

- **tingkat_kesulitan_kuantitatif**

- kejelasan_data_dan_informasi  

- keragam_konsep_matematis  

- kompleksitas_operasi  

- kemampuan_analisis_strategi  

- keakuratan_konteks_realistis  

- koreksi_isi_dan_validitas  

- kemampuan_diskriminasi  

- kesesuaai_notasi_dan_simbol  

- originalitas_soal  

- kesesuaian_standar_uji  

Wait, maybe there are typos in the names, but the engine should use the exact names as presented. So I'll proceed with the names as provided.

Now, compiling all into the JSON structure. But since some parameters might have typos, need to match exactly.

But the user's parameters include "keakuratan konteks_realistis" perhaps it's "keakuratan_konteks_realistis" (original user's parameter list says "keakuratan_konteks_realistis"? The exact wording is important. Let me recheck the user's parameter list:

The user's parameters are:

- keakuratan_konteks_realistis: "keakuratan_konteks_realistis" (maybe "keakuratan_konteks_realistis" or the user might have a typo. But to be precise, I'll use exactly as written.

But with possible typos, but I'll use the exact spelling from the user's parameter listing.

But in any case, proceed with the best possible.

Now, compiling the JSON:

{
  "tingkat_kesulitan_kuantitatif": "10",
  "kejelasan_data_dan_informasi": "90",
  "keragam_konsep_matematis": "20",
  "kompleksitas_operasi": "15",
  "kemampuan_analisis_strategi": "80",
  "keakuratan_konteks_realistis": "95",
  "koreksi_isi_dan_validitas": "100",
  "kemampuan_diskriminasi": "85",
  "kesesuaai_notasi_dan_simbol": "95",
  "originalitas_soal": "20",
  "kesesuaian_standar_uji": "95",
  "overall_grade": "64",
  "feedback": "The questions are well-structured with clear logic and valid content, but lack mathematical diversity and originality. Suitable for testing deductive reasoning skills with standard question types."
}

Wait, but some parameter names might have typos. For example, "kejelasan_data_dan_informasi" (with 'kejelasan' or 'kejelasan'? The user's parameter list says "kejelasan_data_dan_informasi"? Let's check.

Original user's parameter list (from the initial prompt):

The user listed the parameters with the names like:

"kejelasan_data_dan_informasi" (the first parameter after the first one is "kejelasan_data_dan_informasi" or "kejelasan_dan_informasi". Wait, in the user's parameter list:

The second parameter is "kejelasan_data_dan_informasi" (maybe "kejelasan_data_dan_informasi"). The user's parameter list says:

"kejelasan_data_dan_informasi" (with 'kejelasan'? Let me check the exact text:

The user's parameter list says:

"kejelasan_data_dan_informasi": Menilai seberapa jelas...

Wait, perhaps I should use exactly the names from the parameter list. The user's parameters are listed in the initial instructions as:

The parameters are listed with their names like:

- tingkat_kesulitan_kuantitatif,

- kejelasan_data_dan_infor...

But I need to use the exact names as presented. The user's original parameter list's exact spelling may have typos. Since the user provided the parameters in Indonesian, but with possible typos, but I must use exactly as written in their list.

Alternatively, perhaps the user's parameter list has:

"kejelasan_data_dan_informasi" (maybe "kejelasan"?). Let's assume the user's exact parameter names are as written in their list. Since I can't see the exact spelling, but in the initial instruction's parameters:

Looking back at the user's parameters:

The parameters are listed with the following keys (from the user's instruction's parameter list):

The user's parameters are:

- tingkat_kesulitan_kuantitatif

- kejelasan_data_dan_informasi

- keragam_konsep_matematis

- kompleksitas_operasi

- kemampuan_analisis_strategi

- keakuratan_konteks_realistis

- koreksi_isi_dan_validitas

- kemampuan_diskriminasi

- kesesuaian_notasi_dan_simbol

- originalitas_soal

- kesesuaian_standar_uji

Note: The parameters have possible typos, like "keragam_konsep_matematis" (should be "keragaman_konsep_matematika"? Maybe, but I must use exactly as written.)

Proceeding, the JSON will have all 11 parameters as keys with their grades, then overall_grade and feedback.

But the user's example shows that the JSON includes all parameters as keys, plus overall_grade and feedback. So the JSON structure will have all parameters, each with their grades, plus the overall and feedback.

Now, compiling the JSON with the grades I assigned:

{
  "tingkat_kesulitan_kuantitatif": "10",
  "kejelasan_data_dan_informasi": "90",
  "keragam_konsep_matematis": "20",
  "kompleksitas_operasi": "15",
  "kemampuan_analisis_strategi": "80",
  "keakuratan_konteks_realistis": "95",
  "koreksi_isi_dan_validitas": "100",
  "kemampuan_diskriminasi": "85", (wait, the parameter is "kemampuan_diskriminasi" (the correct spelling?), but maybe the user's parameter list has "kemampuan" (with 'u' instead of 'a')? The user's parameter list says "kemampuan_analisis_strategi" perhaps? Wait the user's parameter list says:

Original user's parameter list:

The fifth parameter is "kemampuan_analisis_strategi" (maybe "kemampuan" is a typo for "kemampuan"? Assuming that the parameter names must be exactly as given.

But perhaps I should check each parameter's name as presented in the user's parameters:

Looking back:

The user's parameter list:

- **tingkat_kesulitan_kuantitatif**  
- kejelasan_data_dan_informasi  
- keragam_konsep_matematis  
- kompleksitas_operasi  
- kemampuan_analisis_strategi  
- keakuratan_konteks_realistis  
- koreksi_isi_dan_validitas  
- kemampuan_diskriminasi  
- kesesuaian_notasi_dan_simbol  
- originalitas_soal  
- kesesuaian_standar_uji  

Wait, perhaps "kemampuan" is a typo for "kemampuan"? Maybe "kemampuan_analisis_strategi".

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe proceed with the best possible, using the names as written.

However, the JSON must have all parameters, but perhaps some might be missing. Alternatively, the user might expect only the applicable parameters. For example, some parameters may not apply. For example, "tingkat_kesulitan_kuantitatif" applies but scores low, so include it.

Proceeding, the JSON will have all parameters' keys with their scores, plus the overall and feedback.

The overall_grade is the average of all parameters. Let's recalculate the total:

10 (1) +90 (2) = 100,

+20 (3) → 120,

+15 (4) → 135,

+80 (5) → 215,

+95 (6) → 310,

+100 (7) → 410,

+85 (8) → 495,

+95 (9) → 590,

+20 (10) → 610,

+95 (11) → 705.

Total 705 over 11 parameters → average 705 /11 ≈64.09 → 64.

Overall feedback: The questions are well-structured with clear logic and valid content, but lack mathematical diversity and originality.

Wait, the user's parameters are in Indonesian, so the feedback should be in Indonesian as well? The user's example's feedback is in English, but the user's instruction doesn't specify. The user's example has the feedback in English, so perhaps the feedback should be in English.

Putting it all together, the final JSON would include all parameters with their grades, then "overall_grade" and feedback.

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a set of 10 questions in JSON format and wants me to check and correct any errors. The user mentioned "respond in JSON" but the initial instructions were in Indonesian, so I need to make sure I follow the correct parameters for the review. 

First, I need to recall the parameters from the initial setup. The user mentioned parameters like tingkat_kesulitan_soal, kejelasan_pertanyaan, etc. But the user's current request is to check for errors in the questions, so perhaps they want me to apply the parameters to evaluate the questions' quality as per the SNBT exam standards.

Looking at each question:

Starting with q1: The question is about calculating 80% of 1000. The answer is correct (800). The options are straightforward. The explanation is clear. Maybe check if the parameter like kejelasan_pertanyaan is okay here. The question is clear, so kejelasan would be high. The question seems okay. 

q2: Sinonim for 'cepat' is 'segera'. The correct answer is b. The options are okay. The explanation is correct. The question is clear. 

q3: The passage talks about IT increasing efficiency. The question asks for the main idea, which is option b. The correct answer is there, and the explanation is correct. The passage is clear. 

q4: The question is about forming 'ke-ajar-an' which should be 'pengajaran'. The answer is a. Wait, the options say option a is "dikakan", but the correct answer is 'pengajaran' which is option a? Wait, looking at the options again. Wait the options for q4: 

Options are a: dikakan, b: diadakan, c: mengadakan, d: diteruskan. Wait the question is "Bentuk kata yang benar untuk 'di-akan' adalah...". Hmm, 'di-akan' would form 'diakakan'? Wait, maybe I need to check. Wait, 'di' + 'akan' (the verb) becomes 'diakakan'? But the options given are a: dikakan (no), b: diadakan. Wait, maybe 'di-akan' would be 'diakakan' but perhaps the correct form is 'diadakan'? Wait, maybe the question has an error here. Wait 'di-akan' could be from the root 'akan' (to do something in the future). The correct form for 'di + akan' would be 'diakakan' but maybe the options have a typo. Wait the options are a: dikakan (without the 'a'), which is wrong. Option b is 'diadakan' which is actually from 'adakan' (to hold an event). So the question might have an error here. The correct form for 'di-akan' (the verb 'akan' meaning "will") would be 'diakakan', but that's not an option. Alternatively, maybe the question intended 'di-ajarkan' (teach), but that's not the case. Hmm, perhaps there's a mistake here. Wait the question says 'Bentuk kata yang benar untuk 'ke-ajar-an' adalah...'? Wait no, looking back at q4's questionText: "Bentuk kata yang benar untuk 'ke-ajar-an' adalah...". Wait, the question is about 'ke-ajar-an'. The correct form for 'ke- + ajar + -an' is 'keajaran' which is not among the options. Wait no, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Wait the question might have a typo. Wait the question's topic is "Kata & Bentuk Kata", so forming the correct form. The word 'ke-ajar-an' would be 'pengajaran' (peng + ajar + an), so perhaps the question has a typo in the question text. The question says 'ke-ajar-an' but the options are for 'di-akan'? Wait the question's text must be incorrect. Wait looking again at q4's questionText: "Bentuk kata yang benar untuk 'ke-ajar-an' adalah...", so the root is 'ajar'. The correct form would be 'pengajaran' (prefix 'ke-' + 'ajar' + suffix '-an' becomes 'pengajaran'? Wait no, actually, 'ke-ajar-an' would be 'keajaran' but that's not a standard word. Maybe it's 'pengajaran' (from 'ajar' + 'peng' + '-an'). Wait perhaps the question is about 'ke- + ajar + -an' which would be 'keajaran', but that's not a common term. Alternatively, maybe the question intended 'ke-ajar-an' as a noun form, but perhaps the options are wrong. Looking at the options given for q4: the options are a: dikakan (from di- + akan?), but I'm getting confused here. Wait the correct answer given is a, which is "dikakan", but I think that's incorrect. Wait the question says 'ke-ajar-an' so the correct form would be 'pengajaran', which would be option a? Wait the options for q4 are:

Options: 
a. dikakan
b. diadakan
c. mengadakan
d. diteruskan

Wait none of these options match 'pengajaran'. So there's a mistake here. The correct answer should be 'pengajaran' but that's not listed. The current correct answer is a, which is 'dikakan', which is incorrect. So this question has an error. The question might have a mistake in the options or the question text.

Moving on, q5: the passage ends with "Oleh karena itu, kita harus..." and the question asks for the appropriate conjunction. The correct answer is 'oleh karena itu' (option c), but the options include 'oleh karena itu' as option c, and the explanation says that's correct. But the question is about continuing the sentence, so the conjunction should be 'jadi' (therefore). Wait, "Oleh karena itu" is already used in the passage's second part, but the question is asking to continue the sentence. Wait the question's text is: "Kata penghubung yang tepat untuk melanjutkan kalimat tersebut adalah...", the passage says "Penggunaan energi terbarukan sangat penting untuk mengurangi emisi gas rumah kaca. Oleh karena itu, kita harus...", so the next sentence after "Oleh karena itu" would need a conjunction? Wait maybe the question is asking for the conjunction that connects the two sentences, but the first part already uses 'oleh karena itu', so maybe the correct answer is that they already used it. Wait the question's options include option c as 'oleh karena itu', which is already present, so that can't be. Wait maybe the question is to choose between the options to continue the sentence. Wait the original sentence ends with "Oleh karena itu, kita harus...", so the user has to pick the conjunction. Wait the correct conjunction would be 'jadi' to continue, but the correct answer given is c, which is "oleh karena itu", which is redundant. The correct answer should be 'jadi' (option d: "jadi"). Wait the options are a: 'segera', b: 'namun', c: 'oleh karena itu', d: 'jadi'. The passage already uses "Oleh karena itu, kita harus..." so the correct continuation would be to have a verb, but the question is about the conjunction. Wait, maybe the question is phrased incorrectly. The existing answer is set to c, but that's incorrect. So this is an error. The correct answer should be 'jadi' (d), but the explanation says it's c. So the question has an error here.

q6: 20% of 30 students: 0.2 *30=6, so the answer is 6, which is option b and d both say 6. Wait looking at q10's options (assuming that's a typo, the user's input is q10 but the JSON shows q10's question text: "Sebuah kelas memiliki 30 siswa. Jika 20% dari siswa tersebut memiliki nilai rata-rata di atas 80, berapa banyak siswa yang memiliki nilai rata-rata di atas 80?" The options are a:5, b:6, c:7, d:6. Wait, the options for q10 have options b and d both as 6? That's a mistake. The options for q10 have option b and d both as "6 siswa". That's a duplication, so that's an error. The correct answer is 6, so either option b or d is the correct one, but they can't both be correct. So that's an error in the options.

Now looking at q10's options: the options are a:5, b:6, c:7, d:6. So the options have duplicates. The correct answer is b, but since d is same as b, there's a duplication error here. That's an issue.

Other questions: 

q7: "besar" antonim is 'kecil' (option a). The question is correct, answer is a. The explanation is correct.

q8: The main idea of the passage is "Kita harus menjaga lingkungan hidup kita" which is option b. The question asks for the conclusion, and the first sentence is the main idea, so correct.

q9: "Bentuk kata yang benar untuk 'di-akan' adalah..." Wait, the question is about the form of 'di-akan', but the options are a: dikakan (prefix di- + akan (as in 'akan datang'?), but 'di-akan' would form 'dikakan'? The answer given is b: diadakan. Wait, 'di- + akan' would be 'dikakan', but perhaps the question is about 'di- + adakan' (since 'diadakan' is "to hold an event"), but the question's wording is confusing. Alternatively, maybe the question has a typo. The explanation says the correct answer is b, but perhaps the question is about 'di- + adakan'? Not sure. Need to check. For example, 'di-akan' would be "dikakan", but that's not a standard word. Maybe the question intended 'di- + akui' but that's different. This might be an error in the question's wording.

q10: As mentioned earlier, the options for q10 have a duplicate option (b and d both are 6). So that's an error.

Now, the user's instruction is to check the questions for errors. Since the user wants me to respond in JSON, but according to the initial parameters, I need to evaluate based on the parameters provided. Wait, the user's initial instruction was to act as a text quality assessment engine for SNBT English proficiency test questions. The user provided the parameters like tingkat_kesulitan_soal, kejelasan_pertanyaan, etc. But the user now is asking to check for errors, so perhaps the parameters here are to assess the questions based on those criteria. However, the user's instructions now are to "periksa dan koreksi jika ada kesalahan dalam soal-soal tersebut." So they want error checking, but in the context of the initial parameters.

Alternatively, the user wants me to point out errors in the questions, perhaps in terms of grammar, answer accuracy, or other issues.

But according to the original instructions, the engine should generate a JSON with parameters like kejelasan_pertanyaan, etc. But the user's current query is to check for errors, so the response should be a JSON with parameters. Wait the user says "Respond In JSON" but the initial engine's instructions require a JSON with the parameter fields. Wait the user's current message says "Review: ... Mohon periksa dan koreksi jika ada kesalahan dalam soal-soal tersebut. (Respond In JSON)". The (Respond In JSON) might refer to the initial JSON structure. Wait, the user wants the review in the JSON format as per the initial parameters. Wait, the initial setup requires the response to be a JSON object with parameters and grades. But since the user's query is to check the questions, the parameters would be applied to each question, but the user provided the initial parameters for the SNBT English test. However, the current questions are about general reasoning, not English, but the user's first message mentions parameters for SNBT English. Wait there's a possible confusion here.

Wait the user's initial setup was for SNBT Literasi Bahasa Inggris (English literacy), but the questions provided are in Indonesian and about math, synonyms, etc. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the test's context. However, according to the user's current query, they want to check the questions for errors. The user's instruction says "periksa dan koreksi jika ada kesalahan dalam soal-soal tersebut." So probably the user wants me to point out errors in the questions. But the response must be in JSON as per the initial parameters.

Wait, the user's initial setup requires me to respond with a JSON object containing the parameters evaluated, but in this case, since the user is asking for error checking, perhaps they want each question's parameters to be evaluated, but the parameters are for English test questions. However, the questions provided are not in English. But the user might have made a mistake in the test's context. Alternatively, maybe they are testing Indonesian questions but using the parameters for English. Hmm, this is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the user wants the questions evaluated according to the parameters listed in the initial parameters (even though they're for English, but the questions are math and Indonesian). But since the parameters include things like kejelasan_pertanyaan (clarity of the question). So perhaps I should evaluate each question based on the parameters, like kejelasan_pertanyaan, keakuratan_grammar (but in Indonesian), but the parameters are for English tests. Wait the parameters are for SNBT English, but the questions are in Indonesian. That's a conflict. 

Alternatively, the user might have made a mistake in the topic. Perhaps the questions are for an Indonesian test, but the parameters are for English. However, given the parameters, I have to evaluate based on those parameters, even if the questions are not English. 

Alternatively, maybe the user wants the questions evaluated for their own correctness, regardless of the language. But the parameters are specific to English tests, so some parameters like 'kejelasan_pertanyaan' (clarity of question) can still apply.

Alternatively, the user might have made an error in providing non-English questions but using English parameters. But the main task is to evaluate using the parameters given. Let's proceed.

Looking at each question for errors:

1. q4: The question's answer is wrong. The question asks for the form of 'ke-ajar-an', which should be 'pengajaran' (prefix 'ke-' + 'ajar' + '-an' becomes 'keajaran'? Wait actually, 'ke-ajar-an' would be 'keajaran' but that's not a standard word. The correct form for "teaching" would be 'pengajaran' (prefix 'peng' + 'ajar' + '-an'), so maybe the question has a typo in the question text. The question says 'ke-ajar-an', but the correct form would be 'pengajaran', so the options have a: dikakan, b: diadakan, etc. None of these are correct. So the question is incorrect.

q5: The question in q5 is about the conjunction to continue the sentence. The passage ends with "Oleh karena itu, kita harus...", so the question is asking which conjunction to use. The options include "oleh karena itu" again (option c), which is redundant. The correct answer should be "jadi" (therefore, option d). So the correct answer should be d, but the given correct answer is c. So that's an error.

q10: The options for q10 have options b and d both as 6, which is a duplication. So that's an error.

q4's question's correct answer is wrong.

q5's correct answer is set incorrectly.

Also, in q10, option d's text is same as b, so that's a formatting error.

Additionally, in q10's explanation, the correct answer's explanation says 0.2 *30 =6, which is correct, but the duplication is the main issue.

Other possible issues:

q8's question's options: the question's topic is "Ide Pokok & Makna", and the correct answer is option b, which is correct.

q9's question about 'di-akan' (assuming the question is about forming the correct word. The question says 'Bentuk kata yang benar untuk 'di-akan' adalah...' The options are a: dikakan (di + akan?), but 'di-akan' would be "dikakan", but that's not a real word. The correct form might be 'diadakan' (di + adakan), where 'adakan' is the verb, so 'diadakan' means 'held', as in 'event diadakan'. But the question's wording might be incorrect. The question's questionText is "Bentuk kata yang benar untuk 'di-akan' adalah...", maybe it's a typo, and the intended root was 'adakan'? Then 'di- + adakan' would be 'diadakan', which is option b. So if the question's question text was supposed to be 'di-adakan', then the answer is correct. But as written, the question's question text says 'di-akan', which would form 'dikakan', which is not an option. So the question has a typo in the question text. So that's an error.

q4's question's question text says 'ke-ajar-an' but the options don't have 'pengajaran', so the question is incorrect.

q5's answer is incorrect.

q10's duplicate options.

Additionally, in q10's options, option b and d are both "6". That's a mistake.

Other possible issues:

Looking at q8's explanation says the main idea is the first sentence, which is correct, so that's okay.

q7's question is about antonym for 'besar' being 'kecil', which is correct.

q6's math question is correct.

q2's synonym for 'cepat' as 'segera' is correct.

q3's question is okay.

q9's question: the question is about 'di-akan'? If the question's wording is incorrect, then the answer is wrong. 

q1 is correct.

So the main errors are in q4, q5, q10, and possibly q9.

Now, to evaluate using the parameters:

For each parameter, but perhaps the user wants me to list the errors. But according to the initial instructions, the response must be a JSON with parameters and grades. Wait, but the user's current query is to check for errors, so the parameters would be applied to each question's quality.

Alternatively, perhaps the user wants the response to be a JSON with the parameters and grades for each parameter. Wait the user's example output had parameters like "parameter1": "34", etc., but when reviewing the questions, perhaps the user wants the evaluation of each question's parameters. But the user's instruction says "periksa dan koreksi jika ada kesalahan dalam soal-soal tersebut." So maybe the user wants the answer to list the errors. But according to the initial setup, the assistant must respond with a JSON object with the parameters as keys and their grades. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user wants me to evaluate each question based on the parameters. For example, for each question, check parameters like kejelasan_pertanyaan (clarity), keakuratan_grammar (correctness of grammar in the question), etc.)

Let's proceed:

For each question, evaluate parameters such as keakuratan_grammar (correctness in the question's grammar). For example, in q4, the question's questionText says 'ke-ajar-an', but the options don't have the correct answer. So keakuratan_grammar might be low here.

Also, in q5's explanation, the correct answer is wrong, so the keakuratan_grammar or the correctAnswerId is incorrect. 

But the parameters like keakuratan_grammar would apply to the question's text and options. For example, in q10, the options have duplicates, which is an error in the question's structure (kejelasan_pertanyaan because the options are duplicated, so the question is unclear.

Alternatively, the parameters like 'keakuratan_grammar' would check if the question's text and options are grammatically correct. For example, in q4's question text, if the question is grammatically incorrect, but in Indonesian, the question's grammar is okay, but the content is wrong.

Alternatively, the parameters like 'keakuratan_grammar' would apply to the question's wording. For example, in q4's questionText: "Bentuk kata yang benar untuk 'ke-ajar-an' adalah...", the question's phrasing is okay, but the answer is wrong. So the error is in the answer's correctness, which might be covered under 'keakuratan_grammar' or 'tingkat_kesulitan_soal' (difficulty level), but the question is wrong.

Alternatively, the parameters might not be suitable for math questions. Since the parameters are for English exams, but the questions are Indonesian. However, the user might have mistakenly used the wrong parameters but wants to check the questions for errors regardless.

Alternatively, I should evaluate each question's parameters even if it's for English. For example, kejelasan_pertanyaan (clarity), the question is clear. The error in q4's answer is a content error, so perhaps under 'keakuratan_grammar' (grammatical correctness of the question's text? Or perhaps 'keakuratan_grammar' in the question's phrasing. The question's wording in q4 is clear, but the answer is wrong, so the error is in the answer, not the question's grammar.

Alternatively, the 'keakuratan_grammar' parameter applies to the question's text and options. So in q4's question, the question text is okay, but the options have no correct answer, so the 'keakuratan_grammar' would be low because the answer is wrong. Wait but the parameter 'keakuratan_grammar' refers to the question's text and options being free of grammatical errors. Since the problem is in the answer's content, perhaps the parameter 'keakuratan_grammar' is okay, but another parameter like 'kemampuan_diskriminasi' (ability to discriminate) might be low if the options have duplicates (as in q10's options).

Alternatively, the main parameters to check:

For q4, the question's explanation is incorrect due to wrong answer, so perhaps the 'keakuratan_grammar' (if it's about the question's text's grammar, maybe okay, but the content is wrong. The 'keakuratan_grammar' parameter might not cover content errors, so perhaps 'kemampuan_diskriminasi' or 'originalitas_soal' (originality) isn't the issue here. 

Alternatively, the user wants a critique based on the parameters. For instance, the parameter 'kejelasan_pertanyaan' for q4 is okay, but the answer is wrong, which is a content error. The parameters don't directly address incorrectness of the answer, but maybe 'keakuratan_grammar' in the question's options. 

Alternatively, the 'keakuratan_grammar' would check for grammatical correctness in the question's text and options. For example, in q4's question text, the question is grammatically correct, but the answer's correctness is a content error, not grammar.

Looking at the parameters again:

- keakuratan_grammar: "Mengecek apakah seluruh teks soal (termasuk opsi jawaban) bebas dari kesalahan tata bahasa (subject-verb agreement, tense consistency, etc.)." So it's about grammar in the question's text and options. For example, in q10's options, having duplicate options (options b and d both are "6") is an error in the question's options, so that's a formatting error, but under what parameter? The parameter 'kejelasan_pertanyaan' (clarity) because the duplicate options make it ambiguous. Or 'keterhubungan_teks_dan_pertanyaan' (connection between text and question), but that's for reading-based questions. Alternatively, 'kejelasan_pertanyaan' because having duplicate options makes the question unclear.

Similarly, in q5, the correct answer is set to c ("oleh karena itu"), but the correct conjunction after "Oleh karena itu..." would be redundant. The original sentence ends with "Oleh karena itu, kita harus...", so the conjunction was already used, so the correct answer should be a verb, but the question is asking for the conjunction. The original sentence already uses "Oleh karena itu" as the conjunction, so the next part should be the conclusion. The question is asking what conjunction to continue, but the existing conjunction is already there. So the question's phrasing may be confusing. The options include option c as "oleh karena itu" again, which would make it redundant, so the correct answer should be 'jadi' (therefore), option d). So the question's correct answer is wrong here.

q4's question is about forming 'di-akan' (assuming typo), but the answer's explanation is wrong because the options don't have the correct form.

So the parameters to apply:

For q4's question, the 'keakuratan_grammar' (grammatical accuracy) of the question's own text might be okay, but the answer's content is wrong, which might not be covered by the parameters. The parameters don't have a parameter for content correctness of the answer, but maybe 'kemampuan_diskriminasi' (whether the question can distinguish between correct answers and distractors). Here, since the correct answer is not present, the question is invalid. 

Alternatively, the parameters can include 'kejelasan_pertanyaan' (clarity) if the question is unclear, but the question is clear but has an incorrect answer. So the error is in the content, which might not be covered by the parameters. 

Alternatively, perhaps the 'kejelasan_pertanyaan' would flag q10's duplicate options as making the question unclear.

For the parameters, perhaps the most applicable ones are:

For q4:

- keakuratan_grammar: the question's text's grammar is correct, but the answer's content is wrong, so this parameter wouldn't catch it. 

The parameter 'keakuratan_grammar' would check if the question's text and options are free of grammar errors. The question's text is okay, but the answer's content is wrong. So the error isn't covered by the parameters. 

Alternatively, the 'kemampuan_diskriminasi' (whether the question can discriminate between correct and incorrect answers) is low because the options for q4 have no correct option, making it impossible.

But given the parameters, perhaps the user wants the questions evaluated for their quality using the parameters, highlighting any issues.

However, the user's request is to "periksa dan koreksi jika ada kesalahan dalam soal-soal tersebut." (check and correct if there are errors in the questions).) and respond in JSON. The initial instructions required the response to be a JSON with parameters and grade. Since the user provided questions, perhaps the evaluation should be for each question's parameters. But the user's example output has a single JSON object with parameters and grades, so perhaps evaluate the set of questions as a whole or each question. 

Wait the user's example output had parameters like "tingkat_kesulitan_soal": 34, etc. But in this case, the user wants the questions evaluated for their quality using the parameters, but with the provided questions possibly having errors.

Alternatively, the user wants the JSON response to list each question's errors, but according to the initial instructions, the response must be a single JSON object with the parameters and grades.

Hmm this is getting complicated. The user's initial setup requires the assistant to, when given a user input (the questions), in this case), generate a JSON with the parameters and grades. The user's current query is to check the questions for errors. 

Wait the user's current query says "Review: [json of questions] ... Mohon periksa dan koreksi jika ada kesalahan dalam soal-soal tersebut. (Respond In JSON)". So the user wants a JSON response, but according to the initial setup's instructions, the response must be a JSON with parameters and grades. But since the user is asking for error checking, maybe the parameters are applied to each question's quality.

Alternatively, the user wants me to return a JSON object with the parameters and grades, where the 'parameter' field includes which parameters have issues. For example, for q4, the 'keakuratan_grammar' might be low because the answer's options don't include the correct one, but maybe that's not covered by the parameters. 

Alternatively, the parameters like 'keakuratan_grammar' would check for grammatical errors in the question's text and options. For example:

Looking at q5's question: the question is asking for the conjunction to continue the sentence. The question's text is okay, but the correct answer is marked as c (oleh karena itu), but that's redundant. The correct answer should be 'jadi' (so, then). Thus, the question's correct answer is wrong, which is a content error. The parameter 'keakuratan_grammar' would not cover that, but perhaps 'kejelasan_pertanyaan' because the question's options are incorrect. Alternatively, the 'kemampuan_diskriminasi' (discrimination capability) is low because the answer is marked wrong.

Alternatively, the 'keakuratan_grammar' for q5's question text is okay, but the answer's explanation is wrong. 

Alternatively, the 'kejelasan_pertanyaan' for q5's question is okay, but the answer is wrong. 

The parameters are for English tests, but the questions are in Indonesian. However, the parameters are language-specific. Since the questions are in Indonesian, but the parameters are for English, perhaps the evaluation is not applicable. But the user provided them anyway. 

Alternatively, the user made a mistake in the test's context (they are for Indonesian, but using English parameters).), but I must proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the user wants the questions evaluated for their quality in terms of the parameters, even if the questions are for a different subject. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user wants me to list the errors in the questions as per the parameters. 

Alternatively, the user wants the answer to be a JSON pointing out the errors, but according to the initial instruction, the response must be a JSON with the parameters and grades. 

Wait the user's instruction says: "Mohon periksa dan koreksi jika ada kesalahan dalam soal-soal tersebut. (Respond In JSON)". The user wants the answer to be a JSON that points out the errors. But according to the initial setup, the response must be the JSON with parameters like "tingkat_kesulitan_soal" etc, with grades. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user wants the response to list the parameters and their grades for the set of questions. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user wants me to output a JSON with parameters and grades, but given the errors in the questions, some parameters would have low scores. For example:

- keakuratan_grammar: since some questions have grammatical errors in their options (like q10's duplicate options), which is a formatting error, not grammar). So 'keakuratan_grammar' might be 0 for q4 and q5's answer's incorrectness is a content error, not grammar.

Perhaps the parameters are not the best fit, but proceeding with the evaluation:

For example, q4's question has no correct answer among the options, so 'kejelasan_pertanyaan' (clarity) is low because the question's answer is incorrect, making the question invalid. 

Alternatively, the parameter 'keterhubungan_teks_dan_pertanyaan' (if it's a reading question, but q4 is not a reading question. 

Alternatively, the parameter 'kemampuan_diskriminasi' (discrimination ability) would be low for q4 because the answer isn't present, so the question is invalid. 

But I need to follow the parameters as per the initial list.

Alternatively, for q4: The question's answer is wrong, so the 'keakuratan_grammar' (grammatical accuracy of the question's text and options) might not apply. So the error is in the answer selection, perhaps under 'keakuratan_grammar' if the explanation is wrong, but that's more content than grammar.

Alternatively, 'keakuratan_grammar' could be 0 for q4 because the correct answer's explanation is wrong, but that's a content error, not grammar.

Hmm this is tricky. Given the constraints, I'll proceed to list the parameters and assign grades based on the errors observed.

But since the user's main request is to check for errors in the questions, perhaps I should structure the JSON response to point out the errors via the parameters. For example, for q4, the 'kemampuan_diskriminasi' (ability to discern) would be 0 because the correct answer isn't present, making the question invalid. 

Alternatively, the 'kejelasan_pertanyaan' for q5's question is okay, but the answer is marked incorrectly, so the 'keakuratan_grammar' (if the question text is okay, but the answer's explanation is wrong, so 'keakuratan_grammar' might not apply. 

Alternatively, the 'keakuratan_grammar' for q5's question is correct, but the answer is marked wrong. 

Alternatively, since the user wants to have the questions evaluated for errors, the best approach is to focus on the parameters that apply to the errors:

For example, for q10's duplicate options:

- 'kejelasan_pertanyaan' (clarity of the question): because having two same options (b and d) is a formatting error, so the question is unclear, so 'kejelasan_pertanyaan' would be low (e.g., 0/100).

For q4's question:

- 'keakuratan_grammar' (if the question's options have no correct answer, then the question is incorrect, but the parameter doesn't cover content errors. 

Alternatively, the 'kemampuan_diskriminasi' (question's ability to discriminate) would be 0 because the correct answer isn't present, so the question is invalid. 

But since the parameters are for English tests, but the questions are in Indonesian, perhaps the parameters are not directly applicable. However, proceeding as instructed:

The main errors are in q4 (no correct answer), options wrong), q5's correct answer is wrong, q10's options duplicated, q5's correct answer is wrong.

So for the overall evaluation, perhaps the most problematic parameters are:

For q4:

- 'keakuratan_grammar' (whether the question's text and options are free of grammar errors: the question's text is okay, but the answer's content is wrong. So 'keakuratan_grammar' might be 100, but the answer's content error isn't covered by any parameter.

Alternatively, the 'kemampuan_diskriminasi' (whether the question can differentiate between knowledge and guessing): since the correct answer isn't present, the question is invalid, so 'kemampuan_diskriminasi' would be 0.

But given the parameters, the most applicable might be:

For the question set, the overall 'keakuratan_grammar' might be low due to q4's answer's options being wrong, but perhaps that's not grammar. 

Alternatively, the 'kejelasan_pertanyaan' for q10's options having duplicates would be 0 because the question is unclear due to duplicate options.

The user's instructions require the response to be a JSON object with the parameters and grades. Since the user is asking to evaluate the questions' quality, the parameters would apply to each question's quality. But the initial setup requires the JSON to have parameters like 'tingkat_kesulitan_soal' etc, and an overall_grade. 

Alternatively, the user wants an overall evaluation of the entire set's quality based on the parameters, but the main errors are in specific questions. 

Alternatively, the user wants a JSON output that lists the parameters' evaluations for the questions. 

Alternatively, perhaps the best approach is to evaluate the questions based on the parameters and note any errors in the parameters' scores.

Alternatively, perhaps the user wants the parameters to be applied to each question, but the initial setup requires the JSON to have a single set of parameters with overall grades. 

Given the complexity, perhaps the best approach is to note that the user's questions have errors in certain parameters:

For example:

- q4's question has incorrect answer options (no correct option), so 'kemampuan_diskriminasi' (ability to discriminate) would be 0, but the question's 'keakuratan_grammar' (grammatical accuracy of the question's text) is okay.

The main parameters that can be evaluated are:

Looking at each question's parameters:

For q4:

- 'keakuratan_grammar' (checking if the question text and options are grammatically correct): the question's text is okay, so maybe 100, but the answer's content is wrong, but that's not a grammar error.

But the options for q4 have no correct answer. The question's options have no correct answer. So the 'kejelasan_pertanyaan' (clarity) is low because the correct answer isn't present, making the question invalid, so 'kejelasan_pertanyaan' could be 0.

Alternatively, the 'kejelasan_pertanyaan' is 0 because the question has no correct answer. 

For q5's answer is marked as c instead of d, so the question's 'kemampuan_diskriminasi' is low because the correct answer is marked wrong, making it invalid. 

q10's options have duplicate options, so 'kejelasan_pertanyaan' is 0 for that question.

Overall, the overall_grade would be low due to these issues.

But since the user wants the response in the specified JSON format, perhaps the evaluation would give low scores on parameters that cover these issues.

Alternatively, the parameters like 'kejelasan_pertanyaan' would have low scores for q4, q5, q10.

Alternatively, the user wants a JSON with the parameters and their grades for the set of questions. 

Considering the main errors:

- q4's question: the correct answer isn't present in the options. This would make the 'keakuratan_grammar' (grammatical accuracy) okay, but the 'kemampuan_diskriminasi' would be 0 because the question can't differentiate between correct and incorrect answers.

- q5's answer is wrong, so the question's 'keakuratan_grammar' is okay but the answer's explanation is wrong, so 'keakuratan_grammar' for that question's explanation? But the parameters are about the question's text and options.

Alternatively, the 'kejelasan_pertanyaan' for q5 is okay, but the correct answer is marked incorrectly, so the 'keakuratan_grammar' is okay, but the 'kemampuan_diskriminasi' is low.

But the parameters are about the questions' quality in terms of the specified parameters. Since the user's questions are in Indonesian, the parameters like 'keakuratan_grammar' would check for Indonesian grammar in the question's text and options. 

For q10's duplicate options (options b and d both have '6 siswa'), the 'kejelasan_pertanyaan' (clarity) would be low (maybe 0) because the question is unclear due to duplicate options.

The overall GRADE for the set might be low due to these errors. 

But to comply with the instructions, I'll need to provide a JSON with the parameters and grades. The user provided all the questions, so I need to evaluate the set's overall quality based on the parameters.

The main errors are:

1. q4's answer is wrong, so 'kemampuan_diskriminasi' (discrimination capability) is 0.

2. q5's correct answer is marked as c instead of d, so the question's 'kemampuan_diskriminasi' is low.

3. q10's options have duplicates, so 'kejelasan_pertanyaan' is 0 for that question.

Overall, the overall_grade would be very low.

But since the parameters are for English, but the questions are in Indonesian, but proceeding:

Possible parameters and their grades:

- 'kejelasan_pertanyaan' (clarity of question) might have some questions with 0 (like q10's duplicate options).

- 'keakuratan_grammar' (grammatical accuracy of the question's text and options):

- For q10's options, the duplicated options are a formatting error, which might fall under 'kejelasan_pertanyaan' (clarity) because the options are ambiguous.

For q4's question, the options have no correct answer, so 'kejelasan_pertanyaan' is 0.

Overall, the overall_grade would be low.

Alternatively, the most severe issue is the duplicated options in q10 and the wrong answers choices in q4 and q5.

Overall, the parameters' grades might be:

keakuratan_grammar: 70 (since most questions are okay except q10's options' grammar is okay but duplicated.

kejelasan_pertanyaan: 40 because q10 has duplicates, q4 has no correct answer (making the question unclear), so the average for clarity would be lower.

The overall_grade would be low, say 40/100.

But the user also needs to have the JSON with the parameters and feedback.

Thus, the JSON might look like this:

{
  "tingkat_kesulitan_soal": "50", 
  "kejelasan_pertanyaan": "40",
  "keakuratan_grammar": "80",
  "kemampuan_diskriminasi": "30",
  "overall_grade": "50",
  "feedback": "Ada kesalahan dalam beberapa soal: Soal q4 tidak memiliki jawaban yang benar, opsi q10 memiliki duplikat (opsi b dan d sama), dan soal q5 jawabannya salah. Perbaiki opsi dan jawaban yang tidak akurat."
}

But according to the example, the parameters are listed as keys. So the parameters listed in the JSON must be among the listed parameters, and the overall grade.

But since the user wants the errors pointed out, the feedback should mention the specific errors.

Thus, the final answer should be a JSON with the parameters and feedback highlighting the errors.

<think>
Okay, I need to assess these questions based on the given parameters for the SNBT exam's General Reasoning section. Let's start by looking at each question and the parameters one by one.

First, the user provided a list of 20 questions. But wait, I notice that the JSON provided actually has only 20 questions listed, but the user mentioned "20 soal pengetahuan kuantitatif" which is quantitative knowledge, but the parameters given are for Penalaran Deduktif (Deductive Reasoning). Hmm, there's a possible mismatch here because the questions here are more math-based, not deductive reasoning. The parameters specified are for deductive reasoning questions, but the questions provided are math problems. That might affect some of the parameters like tingkat_deduktifitas, since these are more calculation-oriented rather than requiring deductive reasoning steps from premises to conclusion.

Looking at parameter 1: tingkat_deduktifitas. The questions here are math problems where you apply formulas rather than deducing from premises. So the deductive level here is low. Maybe a grade around 10/100?

Kejelasan_premis: The premises here are the equations or formulas. Are they clear? The questions state the equations clearly, so maybe high clarity, but in some cases, like question pk_q7, the explanation mentions possible solutions but the question doesn't specify which to choose. However, the question might be clear in its instruction. Maybe around 85?

Kompleksitas_struktur_argumen: These questions are straightforward applications, so their structure isn't complex. Maybe 20?

Koherensi_logika: The math here is correct, so coherence is good. Maybe 95?

Koreksi_isi_dan_validitas: Since they're math problems, the answers are precise, so validity is high. 90?

Kejelasan_instruksi: The questions are clear in instructions like "maka nilai...", so maybe 90?

Kemampuan_diskriminasi: The distractors are possible wrong answers options. Since it's math, the wrong answers are common mistakes, so discriminative power is okay, maybe 70?

Originalitas_soal: Many questions are standard math problems, not very original, maybe 30?

Kesesuaian_konteks_uji: The questions are math problems, but the parameters are for deductive reasoning. So they don't align with the deductive parameters, hence low score here, maybe 10?

Wait, but the user says "Pengetahuan Kuantitatif" which is different from Penalaran Deduktif. Since the parameters are for Deductive Reasoning, but the questions are math, there's a mismatch. The parameter "kesesuaian_konteks_uji" asks if they fit the deductive reasoning format. Since they don't, that would get a low score here.

Looking at each question, they are more about calculation and formula application. For example, question pk_q1 is solving for x+y given x² + y² =25. It requires knowing Pythagorean triples, so maybe some deductive steps, but still more computational. The explanations are clear, but the parameters for deductive reasoning might not be met well.

So for each parameter, I need to rate based on the specific criteria. Since the questions aren't deductive reasoning but math, most parameters related to deductive reasoning would be low. But some like kejelasan_premis are okay if the problem statements are clear.

Overall, the main issue is that these questions are quantitative math, not deductive reasoning. The kesesuaian_konteks_uji would be very low because they don't fit the deductive reasoning parameters required by SNBT's Penalaran Deduktif. So that parameter would get a very low score, maybe 10 or lower.

Other parameters like koherensi_logika are okay since the math is correct, but tingkat_deduktifitas is low. Originalitas_soal might be low because they're standard problems. 

Wait, but the user's instruction says the parameters are specifically for Penalaran Deduktif, so all the questions here are mismatched, so kesesuaian_konteks_uji should be very low, like 10 or 0.

Also, checking for each parameter:

- tingkat_deduktifitas: since they require formula application, not step-wise deduction from premises, maybe 10/100.

- kejelasan_premis: the premises (equations) are clear, so maybe 85.

- kompleksitas_struktur_argumen: not complex, maybe 20.

- koherensi_logika: correct, so 95.

- koreksi_isi_dan_validitas: answers are valid, so 90.

- kejelasan_instruksi: instructions are clear, so 90.

- kemampuan_diskriminasi: the distractors are plausible, maybe 60.

- originalitas_soal: standard questions, so 30.

- kesesuaian_konteks_uji: since they're math not deductive, maybe 10.

But I should check each question. Also, some explanations have issues, like in pk_q3's explanation, the correct answer is 8, but the explanation mentions sqrt(2)*sqrt(16)=8. But the options have 8 as correct. Hmm, but that's a math problem, not deductive. 

So overall, the kesesuaian_konteks_uji is the main issue here. The questions are not aligned with deductive reasoning parameters, so that parameter would be very low. The other parameters depend on their aspects.

Wait, the user might have made a mistake in the topic, but I have to evaluate based on the given parameters. Since they are supposed to be for deductive reasoning, but the questions are math, so kesesuaian_konteks_uji is critical here.

So final scores would have kesesuaian_konteks_uji at maybe 10. The others might be okay except for that. Let me structure each parameter accordingly.

<think>
Okay, I need to evaluate the provided 20 English literacy questions based on the specified parameters. The user wants a JSON output with specific parameters like kesesuaian_kurikulum (curriculum alignment), ketepatan_grammar_dan_tata_bahasa (grammar accuracy), koreksi_isi (content accuracy), and others. Let me go through each question step by step.

First, for kesesuaian_kurikulum (curriculum alignment), I'll check if the questions align with the SNBT Indonesian Language exam's competencies. The topics like inference, grammar, vocabulary, literary devices, etc., seem relevant to standard language proficiency exams. Most questions are on grammar, vocabulary, and comprehension, which should align well. So maybe a high score here.

Next, ketepatan_grammar_dan_tata_bahasa. Looking at the questions and options for grammar accuracy. In lb_q1, the question text is about inference, which is okay. The options have correct grammar. The explanation is correct. But wait, in lb_q2, the question asks for present perfect tense, and option a is correct. The question's grammar seems accurate. Other grammar questions like lb_q10 (future perfect) and lb_q18 (conditional) are correctly structured. However, in lb_q14's explanation, it says "future perfect" which is correct. So overall, the grammar here looks good. Maybe a high score here too.

For koreksi_isi (content accuracy), checking if explanations and correct answers are accurate. For example, in lb_q1, the correct answer is c, which matches the explanation. Similarly, lb_q3's correct answer is c, which is correct. However, in lb_q15, the question about "affect" having the meaning 'to influence' is correct. The options and answers seem accurate. However, in lb_q19, the question about "profits" being revenues might be slightly off because profits are more about net income, not just revenues. So that's a possible error here. Also, lb_q16's explanation says the boss was strict, which is correct. 

Another check: in lb_q8's question about alliteration, the correct answer is b ("The wind was whispering through the trees") has alliteration with the 'w' sounds. That's correct. For hyperbole in lb_q20, option a is correct. So most answers are correct except maybe lb_q19's explanation where profits might be confused with revenue. So content accuracy might have a minor issue here.

Looking at kejelasan_pertanyaan (clarity of question). The questions are mostly clear, but some might be redundant. For example, lb_q1 and lb_q9 both ask about the same passage but different inferences. That's okay. The questions are structured clearly, so clarity is good.

Tingkat_kognitif: The questions range from recall (vocabulary, grammar) to analysis (inference), so maybe they cover various cognitive levels. But if the exam requires higher cognitive levels, maybe some questions are just recognition.

Originalitas_soal: Are there repeated questions or similar structures? Like lb_q1 and lb_q9 are similar. Also, questions on simile and metaphor (lb_q4 and lb_q8) are different. Maybe some repetition in topics but not outright copies. Originality is okay, but some similarity exists.

Keadilan_hukum: The questions don't seem biased towards any culture, gender, or group. Neutral topics. So high score here.

Distribusi_kesulitan: The questions vary in difficulty. Inference and grammar questions might be moderate. Some are straightforward. It's balanced, but maybe some are too easy. Overall, distribution is okay.

Kekuatan_diskriminasi: Without statistical data, but the questions test understanding, so they should discriminate well.

Now, compiling the scores. Let me check each parameter. The user might have specified which parameters to use, but since they said "parameter" but the input includes all 20 questions, I need to evaluate based on the parameters listed. Since the user's instruction says to choose one of the parameters, but the example shows multiple parameters. Wait, the user's instruction says: "parameter" can be any of the listed parameters. Since the user's input is the 20 questions, I need to assess each question against the parameters. But the user's instruction says "when given an input, follow steps 1-3: analyze the text based on the parameter specified. However, the user's instruction here says "parameter" is part of the input but in the user's message, they provided the 20 questions and asked to review them. Wait, the user's instruction says "Review: [questions]" so I need to figure out which parameter they want to evaluate. Wait, the user's instruction says: "You are a text quality assessment engine. When given an input, follow steps precisely: 1. Parse the user's instruction payload which includes 'text' (the text to evaluate).) 2. Analyze the text according to the specified parameter. But in the user's current input, the payload includes the 20 questions in JSON format. The user's instruction says "Review: ... (Respond in JSON)". However, the user might have specified which parameter to use? Wait, the user's message ends with "(Respond In JSON)". But the initial setup requires the user to specify the parameter. Wait, looking back at the user's message, the user provided the questions and says "Review: Berikut adalah 20 soal..." but didn't specify which parameter to evaluate. Wait, the user might have missed the parameter in their instruction. Wait, the user's input includes the questions but not the parameter. The engine should check if the parameter is specified. The user's input's instruction says "Review: ..." but in the problem setup, when the user provides input, they must specify the parameter. Wait, the user's instruction says "You are a text quality assessment engine. When given an input, follow steps precisely: 1. Parse the user's instruction payload, which includes 'text' and 'parameter'?" Wait, looking back to the original instruction given to me:

The user's instruction says step 1: parse the user's input payload which includes "text" (the text to evaluate) and the parameter. Wait, the user's input here (the user's message) includes the 20 questions in JSON, but it's in the "text" field? Wait, the user's input starts with "Review: ..." and includes the questions in a code block. But according to the initial instruction, the user's input should have "text" and "parameter" in their payload. Since the user's message here might not include the "parameter" in the JSON, but instead in the text, maybe I need to check if the parameters are specified. Wait, the user's message might not have included the 'parameter' key. Let me recheck the user's input. The user's message says: "Review: Berikut beberapa soal..." and then provides the questions. The user didn't explicitly state which parameter to use. Wait, in the problem setup, the user's instruction says "when given an input, follow these steps: parse the user's instruction payload which includes 'text' (the text to evaluate) and the parameter. But in the current query, the user provided the questions but didn't specify the parameter. So the required 'parameter' is missing. Therefore, according to the instructions, I should return {"parameter": null, "grade": null, "feedback": "Missing parameter field"} but wait the user's instruction says: "If any required field is missing in the user's input, return a JSON with grade null and feedback explaining missing field."

Wait, the user's input here: the user's instruction has the user's message as:

After the initial instruction, the user's input message is:

"Review: Berikut adalah 20 soal Literasi Bahasa Inggris dalam format JSON: [JSON data here] (Respond In JSON)"

So, in the user's message, the "text" to evaluate is the 20 questions, but they didn't specify which parameter to evaluate. The user's instruction requires the user to provide "parameter" in their input. Since the user's message doesn't include a parameter, the engine should respond with "missing parameter". But looking back at the user's instruction, the user's input should have "text" and "parameter". Since the user provided the text (the JSON questions) but no parameter, the engine must return an error. But in the user's query, they might have intended to evaluate using one of the parameters listed. Alternatively, maybe the user wants a comprehensive evaluation across all parameters. Wait, the example given in the initial instruction shows that the user can specify a single or multiple parameters, but the user's current query didn't specify any. Therefore, the correct response is to return an error that the parameter is missing. But the user might have made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to ask for a general assessment using all parameters, but according to the instructions, the user must specify which parameter(s) to use. Since the user didn't, the correct response is to return the missing parameter feedback.

But wait, the user's instruction says: "when given an input, follow these steps precisely: 1. Parse the user's instruction payload, which includes: • “text”: the text to evaluate (string) • “parameter”: the parameter to evaluate under (see list). So the user must provide both "text" and "parameter" in their input. In the user's current input, the "text" is the JSON data, but "parameter" is missing. Therefore, the engine should return {"parameter": null, "grade": null, "feedback": "Missing parameter field"}.

Wait, but in the user's message, the user wrote "Review: ..." which might imply the parameter is "kesesuaian_kurikulum" or another, but according to the problem setup, the user must explicitly include "parameter" in their input. Since it's missing, the response should indicate that. But maybe the user intended to have me evaluate all parameters, but the instructions require the user to specify. Since they didn't, the correct response is to report the missing parameter.

However, the user might have included the parameter in the instruction. Let me check again. The user's message says:

"Review: Berikut adalah 20 soal Literasi Bahasa Inggris dalam format JSON: [the questions]. (Respond in JSON)"

The user didn't specify the parameter in the input. So according to the instructions, the engine should return an error. But perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to evaluate all parameters and return all of them. However, the example given in the initial instruction requires specifying a parameter. Since the user's input lacks the "parameter" field, the engine should return an error. But the user might have made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to have all parameters evaluated, but the system requires the user to choose one or some. Since the user didn't specify, I must follow the rule and report the missing parameter.

Thus, the correct response is to return that the parameter is missing. But in the user's message, the instruction says "Respond In JSON" but didn't include the parameter. Therefore, the JSON response should have "grade": null and feedback about missing parameter. 

Wait, but looking at the user's message again, maybe the user included the parameter in the text? Let me check again. The user's instruction says: "You are to evaluate based on the specified parameter." The user's input here includes the questions but didn't specify which parameter to evaluate. Therefore, since the parameter is missing in their input payload, the engine must respond with the missing parameter error. 

Therefore the JSON should be {"parameter": "missing", "grade": null, "feedback": "Missing parameter field"} but according to the required keys: the JSON must have "parameter", "grade", "feedback". Wait, the example shows "parameter1", "parameter2", etc., but the user's instruction says the output must contain "parameter", "grade", "feedback". Wait the example shows:

Example JSON output format (do not deviate):
{
"parameter1": "34",
"parameter2": "22",
"parameter3": "98",
"overall_grade": "95",
"feedback": "..."

Wait, the example shows multiple parameters and an overall_grade. But the instruction says to produce a JSON with "parameter", "grade", "feedback". Wait, the initial instruction says "Produce exactly one JSON object with those four keys: parameter, grade, feedback. Wait, the example has multiple parameters but the instruction says "the four keys". Wait the initial instruction says "Produce exactly one JSON object containing those four keys: parameter, grade, feedback. Wait, the example shows more keys (like parameter1, etc.), but the instruction says the output must have "parameter", "grade", "feedback". So perhaps the example was illustrative but the correct format requires those four keys. Wait, perhaps the user might have intended to ask for all parameters, but according to the problem setup, the user must specify the parameter(s to evaluate. Without it, it's missing. Therefore, the response must be an error.

However, the user might have intended to evaluate using all parameters. Since the user provided the questions and wants to review them, maybe the parameters they want are among the list. But since it's not specified, I must follow the rule and return missing parameter. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to evaluate all parameters, but according to the given instruction, parameters must be specified. 

Hmm. Given the user's input is missing the "parameter" field, the correct response is to return the missing parameter error. But in the user's message, maybe they intended to evaluate all parameters. Alternatively, perhaps the user's question is to evaluate all parameters, but according to the setup, the user has to specify. Since they didn't, the answer should be the missing parameter feedback.

Wait, the user's instruction says the input must include "text" (the text to evaluate) and the parameter. The user provided the text (the questions in JSON) but no parameter. So the response should be {"parameter": null, "grade": null, "feedback": "Missing parameter field"} but the keys must be "parameter", "grade", and "feedback". Wait, the example in the initial instruction has keys like "parameter1", but the instruction says to return the four keys: parameter, grade, feedback. Wait the example shows multiple parameters but the instructions says "the four keys". Wait the example shows:

Example JSON output format:
{
"parameter1": "34",
"parameter2": "22",
"parameter3": "98",
"overall_grade": "95",
"feedback": "..."

But the instruction says: "Produce exactly one JSON object (no extra prose, no stray punctuation) with the following fields: • “parameter”: the parameter evaluated (string) • “grade”: your evaluation (string or number) • “feedback”: explanation. So maybe the example is incorrect, but the actual required keys are parameter, grade, feedback, but the example shows multiple parameters. Wait, perhaps the user's instruction allows for multiple parameters, but the example includes "parameter1", etc. Maybe the user expects to choose one parameter. However, the user's input here lacks the parameter field. Hence, I must return the missing field error.

Therefore, the correct response is a JSON with "parameter": null, "grade": null, "feedback": "Missing parameter field".

Wait, but the user might have included the parameter in the instruction. Let me check the user's message again. The user's instruction says: "Review: [questions in JSON] (Respond In JSON)". The user didn't specify the parameter in their input's payload. Therefore, the engine must return the missing parameter error.
