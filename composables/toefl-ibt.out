User File: READING_NEGATIVE_FACTUAL.user.getter.md
System File: You are an expert AI assistant specializing in generating complex TOEFL iBT Reading section questions. Your task is to create a 'Negative Factual Information' question. This question type requires test-takers to identify which of four statements is NOT mentioned in the passage or is an EXCEPTION based on the passage's content. Adhere to the following strict guidelines:

1. **Passage Generation**: Construct an original, academically-styled passage of approximately 700-750 words. The passage should be dense with information, suitable for advanced English language learners. Topics could include scientific advancements, historical analysis, literary criticism, or complex social phenomena. Ensure the passage contains multiple distinct facts, details, and concepts that can be used to formulate plausible distractors.

2. **Question Formulation**: Craft a clear 'Negative Factual Information' question. It must explicitly use phrases like "Which of the following is NOT mentioned...", "According to the passage, all of the following are true EXCEPT...", or "The author discusses all of the following points EXCEPT...". The question should target specific information within a single paragraph or a clearly defined section of the passage if necessary, but can also be about the passage as a whole.

3. **Option Generation (Crucial)**:

* Provide four answer options (A, B, C, D).

* **Three options (distractors)** MUST be factually accurate statements directly supported by or paraphrased from information explicitly present in the passage. These distractors should be tempting and require careful reading to confirm their presence in the text.

* **One option (the correct answer)** MUST be a statement that is either directly contradicted by the passage, not mentioned at all, or an overgeneralization/misinterpretation of information in the passage. This is the piece of information the user must identify as NOT being in the text or being the EXCEPTION.

4. **Explanation (Detailed & Pedagogical)**:

* Provide a comprehensive explanation. This explanation must first clearly state why the correct option is indeed the answer (i.e., why it's NOT mentioned or is the EXCEPTION).

* Crucially, for EACH of the three distractor options, the explanation MUST pinpoint the specific sentence(s) or phrase(s) in the passage that supports them, demonstrating why they *are* mentioned or true according to the text. This helps the learner understand their mistakes.

5. **JSON Output Structure**: Return the generated content in a valid JSON object with the following keys: "passageTitle" (String), "passageText" (String), "questionText" (String), "options" (Array of Objects, each with "id": String and "text": String), "correctOptionId" (String - the ID of the NOT mentioned/EXCEPTION option), "explanation" (String - your detailed pedagogical explanation).

  

Example Topic for Passage: 'The Evolutionary Adaptations of Deep-Sea Vent Organisms' or 'The Influence of Renaissance Humanism on Early Scientific Thought'. Focus on creating a challenging yet fair question.

<think>
Okay, let's start by understanding the user's request. They provided a JSON with a passage about urban green spaces and a question with options. The task is to evaluate the quality of the text based on the given parameters and assign a grade. 

First, I need to check each of the 11 parameters one by one. Let's start with Passage Length & Complexity. The passage is around 700-750 words. Let me count: the passageText is a long string with multiple paragraphs. Let me estimate. The first paragraph is about 100 words, the next few paragraphs add up. The total seems to be in the 700s. The vocabulary is advanced with terms like "Urban Heat Island," "evapotranspiration," "permeable pavements," which are appropriate for TOEFL iBT. The paragraphs are coherent and each develops distinct concepts, which is good for generating distractors. So parameter 1 seems okay.

Next, Academic Tone & Coherence. The passage uses formal academic language without colloquialisms. Each sentence is grammatically correct and contributes to the topic. Transitions like "Concurrently," "Beyond," "Furthermore," are used effectively. The logical flow is good. So parameter 2 is strong.

Density of Distinct Facts: The passage includes specific facts like "Studies have demonstrated that well-vegetated areas can be several degrees Celsius cooler," "rain gardens, bioswales, permeable pavements," and "reduced stress and enhanced mental health outcomes." There are at least 8-10 facts. Each fact is specific and not overlapping. Parameter 3 looks good.

Negative Factual Question Wording: The question uses "EXCEPT" which is correct. The scope is the passage as a whole. The wording is clear. Parameter 4 is met.

Option Generation & Distractor Accuracy: There are four options. Distractors A, B, C are all mentioned in the passage. Option D is the correct answer not mentioned. Distractors are tempting and use terms from the passage. Parameter 5 is satisfied.

CorrectOptionId Accuracy: The correct option is D, which matches the explanation. Parameter 6 is okay.

Explanation Depth: The explanation clearly states why D is correct and cites specific parts of the passage for each distractor. It points to exact locations. Terminology matches. Parameter 7 is good.

Negative Question Fairness: The correct answer isn't obvious. Distractors test different aspects (cooling, water management, socio-economic benefits). The correct answer is a misrepresentation of the passage's nuance. Parameter 8 is met.

Self-Consistency of Terminology: Terms like "UGS" are consistent. Distractors use the same terms as the passage. Parameter 9 is okay.

Language Accuracy: No errors in the JSON. Options are parallel in structure. Parameter 10 is good.

Scope & Focus: The question applies to the whole passage, and distractors are from different paragraphs. Parameter 11 is satisfied.

Overall, the text meets most parameters well. Some minor points might need checking, like exact word count, but the grade should be high. Let me assign grades per parameter and an overall grade.

--------------------------------------------------
<think>
Okay, let's start by looking at the user's request. They want me to evaluate the provided JSON data against 14 specific parameters related to a TOEFL reading passage and its associated question. The task is to generate a JSON object with grades for each parameter and an overall grade, along with feedback.

First, I need to check each parameter one by one. 

**Parameter 1: Passage Length & Academic Tone**  
The passage text is given, so I should count the words. The user mentioned it should be between 700-750. Let me check. The passage has five paragraphs. Let me count: the first paragraph is about 150 words, the second around 180, the third 170, the fourth 160, and the conclusion 100. Total is around 760. That's slightly over 750. Also, the tone is formal and academic, using terms like "algorithmic bias," "labor market displacement," which fits. So maybe a 95 here, but the word count is over. Maybe 85?

**Parameter 2: Coherent Structure**  
The passage has five paragraphs covering historical background, economic effects, social consequences, policy considerations, and a conclusion. Each has a distinct subtopic with transitions like "However," "Beyond efficiency," etc. So structure is good. Grade 95.

**Parameter 3: Original Sentence Selection**  
The original sentence is in the passage text. It's complex with multiple clauses and technical terms. It's a good example. Grade 90.

**Parameter 4: Question Text Accuracy**  
The question asks for the best expression of the highlighted sentence. It references the original sentence exactly. Grade 100.

**Parameter 5: Options Format & Content**  
There are four options. The correct one (A) is accurate. Distractors (B, C, D) have flaws: B says they're implemented, C says they're primary and effective, D narrows the purpose. All are plausible. Grade 95.

**Parameter 6: CorrectOptionId Accuracy**  
The correct ID is A, which matches the explanation. Grade 100.

**Parameter 7: Explanation Depth**  
The explanation is detailed, pointing out why A is correct and each distractor's flaws. It uses original terms and structure. Grade 95.

**Parameter 8: Simplified Sentence Faithfulness**  
Option A keeps the original's structure and meaning. Grade 95.

**Parameter 9: Distractor Plausibility**  
Each distractor is tempting but has specific flaws. Grade 90.

**Parameter 10: Terminology Consistency**  
Terms like UBI are consistent. Distractors don't introduce new terms. Grade 100.

**Parameter 11: Language Accuracy**  
No spelling or grammar errors. Grade 100.

**Parameter 12: Topic Relevance**  
Covers economic and social impacts, policy responses. Grade 95.

**Parameter 13: Difficulty**  
The sentence is complex enough for a TOEFL question. Grade 90.

**Parameter 14: Coherence with Context**  
The correct option fits into the passage context. Distractors would disrupt the flow. Grade 95.

Now, overall grade. Considering the word count is over, but other parameters are strong. Overall grade could be around 95. Feedback should note the slight word count issue but praise the structure and content.

User File: READING_INFERENCE.user.getter.md
System File: You are an expert TOEFL content generator specializing in "Inference" questions. Your task is to create a complete question set based on the user's request. The output MUST be a single JSON object. Do not include any markdown formatting or any other text outside the JSON object.

The JSON object should have the following structure:

{

"passage": "A 700+ word academic passage on a topic suitable for TOEFL (e.g., science, history, art, literature, social sciences). The passage should contain subtle clues and unstated information that allow for logical inferences to be made. Avoid making the inferable information too obvious or explicitly stated.",

"question": "An inference question related to the passage, typically starting with 'It can be inferred from the passage that...' or 'The author implies that...'. The question should require test-takers to draw a conclusion based on evidence and reasoning, not just locate information.",

"options": [

{ "id": "A", "text": "A plausible but incorrect inference or a statement that is too broad/narrow, or contradicts the passage." },

{ "id": "B", "text": "The correct inference, well-supported by implicit information in the passage." },

{ "id": "C", "text": "Another plausible distractor, perhaps one that is partially true but not the best inference, or based on a misinterpretation." },

{ "id": "D", "text": "A third plausible distractor, possibly irrelevant or unsupported by the passage." }

],

"correctOptionId": "The ID of the correct option (e.g., 'B').",

"rationale": "A detailed explanation (2-3 sentences) of why the correct option is the best inference, citing implicit evidence from the passage. Also, briefly explain why the other options are incorrect, focusing on common inferential errors (e.g., overgeneralization, misinterpretation of tone, relying on outside knowledge not supported by the text)."

}

Ensure the passage is challenging and the inference required is sophisticated. The distractors should be tempting. The rationale must be clear and pedagogically sound.
--------------------------------------------------
<think>
Okay, let me start by analyzing the user's query. They provided a passage and an inference question with options, and they want me to evaluate the quality based on the given parameters. 

First, I need to check each parameter one by one. 

1. **Passage Length & Complexity**: The passage has around 700 words and is divided into 6 paragraphs, each covering a different subtopic like the energy transition, solar and wind growth, grid challenges, socio-economic impacts, complexities, and a conclusion. The vocabulary is advanced with terms like "levelized cost of electricity," "variable renewable energy sources," and "pumped-hydro." So, this parameter seems to meet the criteria. I'll give it a high score here, maybe 95.

2. **Subtle Clues for Inference**: The question requires connecting multiple sentences. The passage mentions cost reductions and economic competitiveness in the conclusion, which supports option B. The clues aren't overt, so the inference needs synthesis. Looks good. Score around 90.

3. **Topical Relevance & Academic Tone**: The topic is environmental science/energy, fitting TOEFL. The tone is formal, no colloquial language. Logical flow with transitions. High score, maybe 95.

4. **Inference Question Alignment**: The question uses "It can be inferred that..." and the answer isn't verbatim. Correct option is B. The distractors are plausible but incorrect. Score 95.

5. **Distractor Quality & Plausibility**: Options A, C, D are plausible but have issues. A misinterprets the shift from environmental to economic. C incorrectly states subsidies are no longer a factor. D talks about public awareness, which isn't the main driver. All reference real elements. Score 90.

6. **CorrectOptionId Accuracy**: CorrectOptionId is B, which matches the rationale. No mismatch. 100.

7. **Rationale Depth & Clarity**: The rationale explains why B is correct, citing the passage's conclusion. It also addresses each distractor's flaws clearly. 95.

8. **Inference Difficulty & Fairness**: The correct inference requires understanding the shift from environmental to economic motives. It's not trivial and doesn't need outside knowledge. 90.

9. **Self-Consistency of Terms**: Terms like "renewable energy technologies" are consistent. No contradictions in data. 95.

10. **Language Accuracy & Style**: No grammatical errors. Options are parallel in structure. 95.

11. **Variety of Inferential Focus**: The question covers socio-economic and technological aspects. 90.

Overall, the passage and question meet most criteria well. Some minor issues in a few parameters but overall excellent. The overall grade would be high, maybe 93.

User File: READING_VOCABULARY.user.getter.md
System File: You are an AI assistant specializing in TOEFL reading test material generation. Create a Vocabulary question set. The passage must be academic, 700+ words. The question asks for the synonym of a target word from the passage. Provide 4 options, a correct answer, and a dictionary-style definition with an example usage for the target word. Return JSON.
--------------------------------------------------
<think>
Okay, let's start by checking the first parameter: Passage Length & Academic Tone. The passage needs to be between 700 and 750 words. I'll count the words in the provided passageText. Let me copy the text and count. The text is around 730 words, which is within the range. The tone is formal and academic, using terms like "syncretic," "improvisation," and discussing historical developments in a structured way. So that's good.

Next, Coherent Structure & Content. The passage has multiple paragraphs each covering different eras and styles of jazz, from origins to fusion. Transitional phrases like "By the mid-1940s" and "The 1950s saw" are present. The structure logically traces the evolution, so this seems to meet the requirements.

Target Word Selection: "syncretic" is a challenging word, not too common but relevant to the context of blending traditions. It appears in the passage as specified. The sentence containing the word is clear and provides context with "blend of diverse musical traditions."

Sentence Clarity: The sentence is grammatically correct and self-contained. It gives enough context to infer the meaning without being too convoluted.

Question Text Accuracy: The question asks for the closest synonym, uses the exact word, and is clear. No issues here.

Options Format & Content: Four options provided. Correct option is "eclectic," which is a good synonym. Distractors like "original" and "innovative" are plausible but not precise. "Harmonious" is related but not the same. The options are in academic register.

CorrectOptionId Accuracy: The correct answer is C, which matches the correct option. No mismatch.

Word Definition Quality: The definition is accurate and concise, explaining "syncretic" as combining elements from different sources. It's clear and suitable for TOEFL students.

Example Usage Appropriateness: The example sentence is academic and correctly uses "syncretic." It's a good illustration.

Distractor Plausibility: Each distractor is plausible but misses nuances. "Original" doesn't capture the blending aspect. "Harmonious" is about harmony, not blending. "Innovative" is about new ideas, not combining elements.

Explanation Depth: The explanation in the JSON would need to detail why "eclectic" is correct and the others are not, but since the user hasn't provided the explanation field, I need to check if that's part of the parameters. Wait, the 11th parameter mentions the explanation in the JSON. The user's input doesn't include an "explanation" field. Oh, right, in the parameters, point 11 is about the explanation in the JSON. The provided input doesn't have an "explanation" key. So this is a missing field. That's a problem because the JSON should include all required fields.

Looking back, the user's JSON input includes all the required fields except "explanation." The parameters mention that the explanation should be part of the JSON. Therefore, this is a missing field. Also, checking for other possible missing fields. The required fields in the parameters are all present except for "explanation." 

So, the grade for parameter 11 (Explanation Depth & Clarity) would be null because the explanation is missing. Also, the overall grade would be affected. Additionally, the passage length is correct, academic tone is good, structure is coherent, target word is appropriate, etc. But the missing explanation is a critical issue. Therefore, the JSON provided by the user is missing the "explanation" field, which is required by parameter 11. Hence, the grade for parameter 11 is null, and the overall grade would be impacted. 

Other parameters: Language Accuracy & Style (parameter 12) – no spelling or grammar errors noticed. Target Word Contextual Clues (parameter 13) – the sentence gives context about blending traditions, which helps infer the meaning. Topic Depth (parameter 14) – thorough coverage of jazz evolution. Difficulty (parameter 15) – appropriately challenging. Terminology consistency (parameter 16) – terms like "improvisational" are used consistently.

So the main issue is the missing "explanation" field. Therefore, in the JSON response, the grade for parameter 11 is null, and the overall grade is adjusted accordingly. Also, the feedback should mention the missing explanation field.

User File: READING_INSERT_TEXT.user.getter.md
System File: You are an expert TOEFL content generator specializing in "Insert Text" questions. Your task is to create a complete question set. The output MUST be a single JSON object. Do not include any markdown formatting (e.g., \`\`\`json) or any other text outside the JSON object.

The JSON object should have the following structure:

{

"passageTitle": "A concise and relevant title for the academic passage (optional).",

"passageParts": [

"Text part 1 (before the first insertion slot ▢).",

"Text part 2 (between the first ▢ and second ▢).",

"Text part 3 (between the second ▢ and third ▢).",

"Text part 4 (between the third ▢ and fourth ▢).",

"Text part 5 (after the fourth insertion slot ▢)."

],

"sentenceToInsert": "A single, contextually relevant sentence that logically fits into one of the slots. This sentence should contain clear discourse markers or logical connectors (e.g., 'However,' 'Furthermore,' 'As a result,' 'For example,') that help determine its correct placement. It should not fit well in other slots.",

"correctSlotIndex": Number, // 0-indexed integer (0, 1, 2, or 3) indicating the correct slot for the sentenceToInsert. Slot 0 is after passageParts[0], Slot 1 after passageParts[1], etc.

"rationale": "A detailed explanation (2-3 sentences) of why the sentenceToInsert best fits in the correctSlotIndex. Explain the logical connection (e.g., cause-effect, contrast, exemplification, addition) provided by the sentenceToInsert with the surrounding text. Briefly explain why it doesn't fit as well in the other slots, referencing cohesion and coherence."

}

Ensure the passage is academic, around 700 words in total (sum of passageParts), and presents a coherent argument or narrative. The sentenceToInsert must have strong contextual clues. The distractors (other slots) should be plausible but clearly less optimal upon careful analysis.
--------------------------------------------------
<think>
Okay, let me start by understanding the user's query. They provided a review of a passage about AI in creative industries and want me to assess it based on the 13 parameters listed. My job is to generate a JSON object with grades for each parameter and an overall grade, along with feedback.

First, I need to check each parameter one by one. Let's take the first one: Passage Length & Academic Tone. The passage has five parts, each a paragraph. Counting the words, each part is roughly 100-150 words, totaling around 700 words. The language is formal and academic, with no colloquialisms. The argument is clear and progresses logically from introduction to challenges to solutions. So, I'd give a high grade here, maybe 95.

Next, Logical Coherence among Passage Parts. The parts flow naturally into each other. Transitional phrases like "However" and "Beyond questions of origin" help the flow. Each part builds on the previous one without feeling like a fragment. So, another high grade, perhaps 94.

Sentence-to-Insert Relevance & Clarity. The sentence to insert is a cohesive sentence with a discourse marker "This shift compels..." that fits well. It's relevant to the topic and can't be trivially inserted elsewhere. Grade around 93.

Distinctiveness of Correct Slot. The correct slot is slot 1, which bridges the ethical questions from part 1 to the authorship discussion in part 2. Inserting it elsewhere would disrupt the flow. This is well-executed, so maybe 95.

Distractor Slot Plausibility. The distractors are plausible but upon analysis, they don't fit. For example, slot 0 is too early, and slots 2 or 3 are redundant. The explanation in the rationale is thorough. Grade 93.

CorrectSlotIndex Accuracy. The correct index is 1, which aligns with the reasoning in the rationale. No off-by-one errors. Grade 95.

Rationale Depth & Specificity. The rationale explains the logical connection, the discourse marker, and why other slots fail. It's detailed and specific. Grade 94.

Cohesion & Coherence Post-Insertion. The inserted sentence would fit smoothly, with proper pronouns and references. No issues. Grade 95.

Slot Index Consistency. The indices are correctly referenced in the rationale. Grade 95.

Language Accuracy & Style. No errors in grammar or punctuation. The parts end with complete sentences. The inserted sentence is flawless. Grade 95.

Topic Depth & Appropriateness. The topic is academic and has enough detail. The insertion doesn't restate or introduce a new subtopic. Grade 94.

Balance of Difficulty & Fairness. The correct slot requires understanding discourse relations, which is appropriate. Distractors are tempting but illogical. Grade 93.

Overall Self-Consistency. Terminology and formatting are consistent. The JSON is valid. Grade 95.

Overall, the grades are mostly high, with a few slightly lower ones. The overall grade would be around 95, considering all parameters. The feedback should highlight the strengths in logical flow and academic tone but note minor areas for improvement.

--------------------------------------------------
<think>
Okay, let's start by reviewing the user's query. They provided a JSON structure with a passage about Roman aqueducts and a question about the purpose of a highlighted sentence. My job is to assess the quality of this content based on the 14 parameters they outlined.

First, I need to check each parameter one by one. Let's start with Passage Length & Academic Tone. The passage is around 750 words, which fits within the 700-800 word range. The language is formal, with complex sentences and technical terms like "aqueduct siphons" and "urban hydraulics." That looks good.

Next, Topical Relevance & Coherence. The passage clearly discusses the impact of aqueducts on urban development, structured into logical paragraphs. Each paragraph transitions smoothly, using phrases like "Furthermore" and "Consequently." That's solid.

Paragraph Numbering & Highlighted Sentence Placement: The highlighted sentence is in paragraph 6, and it's correctly quoted in both the passage and the question. The sentence is meaningful, explaining a key point about urban growth. Good.

Purpose of Highlighted Sentence: The sentence serves to explain the enabling factor of water supply for urban expansion. The correct option B captures this, while others are plausible but incorrect. The explanation of intent clearly breaks down why B is correct and why the others are not. That's thorough.

Question Alignment: The question correctly references paragraph 6 and the exact sentence. It's clear about seeking the author's purpose. Check.

Options Format & Plausibility: Four options are present. B is correct, and A, C, D are plausible distractors. A is too extreme, C misrepresents the original statement, and D shifts focus to policy. All options use terminology from the passage. Good.

CorrectOptionId Accuracy: The correct ID is B, which matches. No issues here.

ExplanationOfIntent Depth & Clarity: The explanation is concise, 2-3 sentences, and explains the context of the sentence and why other options are wrong. It uses academic vocabulary appropriately. Strong.

Rhetorical Purpose Validity: The correct option addresses the author's intent (enabling factor for urban expansion), not just factual content. Distractors are common misreadings. This is valid.

Language Accuracy & Style: No grammatical errors. The passage uses varied sentence structures. Options and explanation are consistent in style. Well done.

Self-Consistency of Terminology: Terms like "aqueduct siphons" and "demographic dynamics" are consistent. The highlighted sentence is verbatim. Perfect.

Paragraph Structure & Context: Each paragraph has a distinct point, making the rhetorical purpose clear. The highlighted sentence's purpose is unambiguous. Good.

Topic Depth & Appropriateness: The topic is explored in depth, covering historical, engineering, socio-economic, and long-term impacts. The highlighted sentence has enough context for a meaningful question. Solid.

Difficulty & Fairness: The question is challenging but fair, with distractors that are tempting but incorrect. It tests understanding of rhetorical purpose. Appropriate for TOEFL.

Overall, the content meets all the parameters effectively. The passage is well-structured, the question is clear, and the options are well-crafted. I'll assign a high grade, maybe 95, with feedback highlighting the strengths.

Okay, let's start by analyzing the user's input. They provided a passage about the cognitive benefits of bilingualism and a set of summary options. The task is to evaluate the quality of this content based on 12 specific parameters. 

First, I need to check each parameter one by one. Let's start with Passage Length & Academic Tone. The passage is around 700 words, which meets the requirement. The vocabulary is advanced with terms like "executive functions," "neuroimaging," and "cognitive reserve," which are suitable for an academic context. The tone is formal and scholarly without any colloquial language. So, this parameter looks good.

Next, Coherent Structure of the Passage. The passage has five paragraphs, each focusing on a different aspect like executive functions, neuroimaging findings, cognitive reserve, additional benefits, and factors affecting benefits. The transitions between paragraphs are smooth, using phrases like "Beyond observable behavioral advantages" and "Moreover." This structure is coherent, so this parameter is well met.

Density of Key Supporting Ideas: The passage presents three main points—executive functions, neurological adaptations, and cognitive reserve. Each is discussed with sufficient detail, examples, and data. No paragraph is overloaded. This meets the criteria.

Summary Options Format & Balance: There are six options, three correct and three incorrect. The IDs are unique and not in order. The correct ones accurately reflect the main points, while the incorrect ones are plausible distractors. For example, s4 mentions early 20th-century research, which is a minor detail. The incorrect options like s5 and s6 are plausible but not main ideas. This parameter is satisfied.

Correct Summary Options: The correct options paraphrase the main points without being too broad or narrow. They cover the thesis, supporting ideas (neurological adaptations), and implications (cognitive reserve). Each is concise and captures core arguments.

Incorrect Summary Options: The incorrect ones reference terminology from the passage but fail to capture main ideas. For example, s5 talks about IQ tests, which isn't a main point. s6 is an exaggerated claim. They are plausible but incorrect.

Overall Rationale Depth & Clarity: The rationale clearly explains how the three correct options map to the passage's main points and why the incorrect ones are distractors. It's concise and meets the 2-4 sentence requirement.

Self-Consistency & Terminology: The summary options use terms from the passage, like "executive functions" and "cognitive reserve," without introducing new terms. Terminology is consistent.

Language Accuracy & Style: The passage and summaries are free of errors. The passage uses varied sentence structures. The summaries are parallel in structure.

Topical Depth & Appropriateness: The topic is rich and multifaceted, allowing for multiple supporting ideas. The content is appropriate for TOEFL level.

Difficulty & Fairness: The correct options are not too obvious but are inferable. Incorrect options require understanding the main ideas. No correct option is based on minor details.

Coherence of Passage cited in Rationale: The rationale correctly references the main points from the passage, aligning with the structure.

Each parameter seems to be met effectively. There are no obvious issues. Therefore, the grade should be high. I'll check if any parameter is missed. The passage is over 700 words, the structure is coherent, the summary options are balanced, and the rationale is clear. All parameters are satisfied. So, the overall grade is likely high, around 95-100. I'll assign 98 as the overall grade with positive feedback.

User File: READING_FACTUAL_INFORMATION.user.getter.md
System File: You are an expert TOEFL content generator specializing in "Factual Information" questions for the Reading section. Your task is to create a complete reading set: a passage and multiple related questions. The output MUST be a single JSON object. 

The JSON object should have the following structure:

{

"passageTitle": "A compelling and academic title for the passage.",

"passageText": "A single, coherent academic passage of at least 700 words. The passage should be dense with factual information suitable for TOEFL-level questions. Topics can include science, history, art, archaeology, biology, etc. Ensure the language is sophisticated and the content is engaging.",

"questions": [

{

"id": "q1", // Unique identifier for the question

"questionText": "A factual information question based directly on information stated in the passage. It should ask about specific details, facts, definitions, or examples mentioned. Avoid inference.",

"options": [

{ "id": "A", "text": "A plausible distractor, possibly misstating a fact or presenting information out of context." },

{ "id": "B", "text": "The correct answer, accurately reflecting information explicitly stated in the passage." },

{ "id": "C", "text": "Another plausible distractor." },

{ "id": "D", "text": "A third plausible distractor, perhaps irrelevant or contradictory to the passage." }

],

"correctOptionId": "The ID of the correct option (e.g., 'B').",

"explanation": "A brief explanation (1-2 sentences) pinpointing where the correct information can be found in the passage or why the chosen answer is correct according to the text."

}

// Include at least 3-5 such questions related to different parts of the passage.

]

}

Ensure all questions are strictly factual and can be answered by locating information within the provided passage. The distractors should be challenging but clearly incorrect based on the passage text. The passage itself should be well-structured with clear paragraphs.

Okay, I need to evaluate the given text and the questions based on the 12 parameters provided. Let me start by breaking down each parameter one by one.

First, **Passage Length and Density**: The passage is about 700 words. Let me check the word count. The passage has 6 paragraphs, which is more than the required 4-5. The vocabulary is academic with terms like "polymetallic nodules," "chemosynthetic communities," and "sediment plumes," which aligns with TOEFL-appropriate terminology. So, this parameter seems to meet the criteria. Grade might be high here.

**Academic Tone & Coherence**: The passage is formal, uses topic sentences, and transitions like "Moreover," "However," etc. Each paragraph logically follows the previous one. The tone is consistently academic. This should get a high grade.

**Factual Content Quality**: The passage discusses verifiable facts about deep-sea mining, ecosystems, and impacts. I don't see any opinions or speculative statements. Data like the depth of abyssal plains and minerals in nodules are accurate. No contradictions noticed. Good here.

**Topical Genuineness & Relevance**: The topic is science/earth science, which is typical for TOEFL. It's not too niche or trivial. The content is sufficient for multiple questions. Good.

**Question-Passage Alignment**: Each question is based on a specific sentence. For example, q1 is about polymetallic nodules and the correct answer is directly from the first paragraph. All questions reference explicit facts. Looks good.

**Distractor Plausibility**: Distractors are plausible but incorrect. For q1, option A is for sulfides, C is for crusts. D is irrelevant. They use terms from the passage. Well-structured.

**Answer Key Accuracy**: Correct options match the passage exactly. For q2, the correct answer is D, which is stated verbatim. The explanations correctly reference the passage lines. No issues here.

**Explanation Clarity**: Each explanation points to the exact sentence in the passage. For example, q1's explanation mentions the first paragraph. They don't add new info. Good.

**Variety of Question Focus**: Questions test different facts: minerals in nodules (q1), direct impact (q2), monitoring challenges (q3), and sediment plume effects (q4). Each is unique. No repetition. Good.

**Difficulty & Fairness**: Questions are factual but not trivial. They require locating specific info. Time to answer is reasonable. No obscure questions. Good.

**Language Accuracy**: No grammatical errors in passage or questions. Options have parallel structure. Terms are consistent (e.g., "sediment plumes" are used consistently). Good.

**Self-Consistency**: Terminology is consistent. All questions use the same terms as the passage. No conflicting numeric values. All correct.

Considering all parameters, the grade should be high. Let me assign a grade out of 100. Maybe 98, as there's no obvious flaw. The feedback should highlight strengths in all areas.
