Pilihan distraktor cukup efektif, meskipun beberapa soal kurang orisinal. Tidak seluruhnya sesuai kurikulum SNBT karena kesalahan perhitungan dalam beberapa contoh."\n}', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, reasoning='Okay, I need to assess the provided questions based on the specified parameters. Let\'s start with the first parameter: **akurasi_fakta_dan_istilah**. \n\nLooking at the first question (id: lit_id_q1), the problem states a farmer picking mangos with a profit calculation. The answer explanation mentions a discrepancy in the calculations leading to a correct answer of 30, but the explanation\'s math shows 30, which matches option C. However, the explanation\'s initial calculation might be correct, but the question\'s phrasing seems okay. The terms like "keuntungan" (profit) are correctly used. However, in the explanation, the user mentions a possible error in the question\'s data but the answer provided aligns with the given options. So accuracy of terms is okay, but there might be a calculation mistake in the explanation, but the question itself uses correct terms. Grade: 80.\n\nNext, **koreksi_isi_dan_validitas**: For question 1, the explanation points out a potential inconsistency in the question\'s data leading to an impossible scenario (negative oranges picked), but the provided answer still fits the given options. This inconsistency makes the question invalid. Grade: 60.\n\n**relevansi_kurikulum_SNBT**: The topics are math-focused, which aligns with quantitative reasoning. All questions seem relevant. Grade: 90.\n\n**kompleksitas_kognitif**: Many questions require calculations and problem-solving, but some might be straightforward (like question 4). Overall, moderate complexity. Grade: 75.\n\n**originalitas_soal**: Some questions are standard (e.g., profit calculation), but some might be common. Grade: 70.\n\n**kejelasan_instruksi**: Instructions are clear, but some questions have ambiguous phrasing (e.g., "3 hari berikutnya" in question 1). Grade: 80.\n\n**kemampuan_diskriminasi**: Distractors are plausible but some incorrect options might not be strong. Grade: 75.\n\n**kedalaman_pengetahuan**: Most questions test application, but some are formulaic (e.g., question 4\'s average calculation). Grade: 70.\n\nOverall, some questions have internal inconsistencies (like question 1\'s negative result), but most are technically correct. Overall grade: 75.\n')

Kompleksitas pola perlu ditingkatkan dengan pola multi-langkah."\n}', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, reasoning="Okay, I need to assess the quality of the provided TPS questions for the SNBT exam based on the given parameters. Let me start by recalling the parameters specified. The user mentioned parameters like tingkat_induktifitas, kompleksitas_pola, keragaman_tipe_stimulus, tingkat_kognitif_analisis, kejelasan_instruksi, koreksi_isi_dan_validitas, kemampuan_diskriminasi, originalitas_soal, and keterkaitan_dengan_konteks_uji.\n\nFirst, looking at tingkat_induktifitas, which measures how much the questions require inductive reasoning from examples to generalization. The questions here are mostly arithmetic and ratio problems. Most require direct calculations rather than pattern induction. So maybe low inductivity, perhaps a score around 30/100.\n\nNext, kompleksitas_pola. The questions involve arithmetic operations, percentages, ratios, and basic geometry. The patterns are straightforward, not multi-step. Maybe a score around 40/100.\n\nKeragaman_tipe_stimulus: The questions cover several topics like percentages, ratios, geometry, and unit conversions. They use different contexts (money, time, area), which adds variety. Maybe 70/100.\n\nTingkat_kognitif_analisis: Most questions require breaking down problems into steps (e.g., calculating profit, ratios), so maybe 60/100.\n\nKejelasan_instruksi: The questions are clear, instructions are explicit. Maybe 85/100.\n\nKoreksi_isi_dan_validitas: The questions are logically consistent with no ambiguities. Maybe 90/100.\n\nKemampuan_diskriminasi: The questions are standard, so they might not distinguish well between high and low ability test-takers. Maybe 50/100.\n\nOriginalitas_soal: Some are common problems (like Pythagoras, profit calculations), so maybe 60/100.\n\nKeterkaitan_dengan_konteks_uji: They match typical SNBT quantitative reasoning topics, so 80/100.\n\nWait, but let me check each parameter again carefully. For tingkat_induktifitas, since the questions are more computational than inductive (like predicting patterns), maybe lower. Maybe 20/100. \n\nKompleksitas_pola: Some involve multiple steps (like the problem with two taps, or the discount calculations), so perhaps 50/100.\n\nOriginalitas_soal: Some questions are standard, but the explanations are clear. Maybe 65/100.\n\nHmm. Need to ensure each parameter is evaluated properly. The user wants numerical or categorical grades. Also, the JSON must have all the required keys.\n\nWait the user's example had numerical grades and feedback. I'll assign scores as numbers between 0-100 for each parameter.\n\nFor instance, tingkat_induktifitas: 25 because most questions are direct calculations, not inductive pattern finding.\n\nKompleksitas_pola: 40 since some require multi-steps but not highly complex.\n\nKeragaman_tipe_stimulus: 70 because different contexts (money, geometry, ratios).\n\nTingkat_kognitif_analisis: 60, as they require step-by-step analysis.\n\nKejelasan_instruksi: 90, instructions are clear.\n\nKoreksi_isi_dan_validitas: 95, since no ambiguities mentioned.\n\nKemampuan_diskriminasi: 50, as questions are standard, so maybe not highly discriminative.\n\nOriginalitas_soal: 65, as some are common but presented clearly.\n\nKeterkaitan_dengan_konteks_uji: 85, align with typical exam topics.\n\nPutting this all together into JSON format with each parameter's grade and feedback. Also, check if all parameters are included and feedback is concise.\n")

Soal lebih fokus pada logika deduktif daripada kuantitatif."\n}', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None, reasoning='Okay, let\'s see. The user provided a JSON array of 10 deductive reasoning questions and wants me to evaluate them based on the specified SNBT parameters. But wait, the parameters mentioned are for math problems, specifically for Penalaran Umum (Quantitative Reasoning) in SNBT. The questions here are about deductive reasoning, which might not directly align with the parameters given, which focus on mathematical aspects like difficulty level, clarity of data, mathematical concept variety, etc.\n\nHmm, the user\'s original request was to assess the quality of math questions using those specific parameters. But the provided questions are about logic (syllogism, equivalence, etc.), not quantitative reasoning. This mismatch might mean the assessment parameters aren\'t applicable here. \n\nI need to check each parameter\'s applicability. Parameters like "tingkat_kesulitan_kuantitatif" (quantitative difficulty) or "keragaman_konsep_matematis" (mathematical concept variety) are about math concepts, but the questions are on logic. The feedback should note that the questions don\'t align with the math-focused parameters, making the evaluation invalid. \n\nSo, the correct approach is to point out that the questions provided are deductive logic-based, not quantitative reasoning, so the parameters can\'t be applied. The JSON should have "grade": null and feedback explaining the mismatch between the question type and the assessment criteria provided.\n')
