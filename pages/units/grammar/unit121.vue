    id: 1,
    text: "The 11:45 train is very reliable. It almost always leaves exactly _______.",
    options: ["on time", "in time"],
    correctAnswer: "on time",
    explanation: "The phrase 'on time' means punctually, at the scheduled time. The sentence emphasizes the train's adherence to a precise schedule, making 'on time' the correct choice. 'In time' would imply leaving early enough for some other purpose, which doesn't fit the context of a scheduled departure."
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    text: "We were worried we would miss the start of the film, but we managed to get to the cinema just _______ to see the opening credits.",
    options: ["on time", "in time"],
    correctAnswer: "in time",
    explanation: "'In time' means with enough time to spare or before the last possible moment. The context of being 'worried' suggests a close call, not punctuality. They arrived before it was too late to see the credits, which is the core meaning of 'in time'."
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    text: "_______ of his long speech, the CEO announced a surprise bonus for all employees, which nobody was expecting.",
    options: ["At the end", "In the end"],
    correctAnswer: "At the end",
    explanation: "'At the end' refers to the specific point when something finishes. The speech is a defined event with a clear beginning and end. The announcement happened at the final point of that event. 'In the end' refers to a final outcome after a long process or period of uncertainty, which is not the meaning here."
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    text: "The project faced many budget cuts and delays. It seemed like it would be cancelled, but _______, we managed to complete it successfully.",
    options: ["at the end", "in the end"],
    correctAnswer: "in the end",
    explanation: "'In the end' means 'finally' or 'eventually,' highlighting a conclusion after a period of difficulty or uncertainty. The sentence describes a challenging process ('budget cuts and delays'), making the successful completion a final outcome. 'At the end' would require a specific noun, like 'at the end of the project'."
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    text: "I want to be there for my daughter's graduation ceremony. I have to make sure I arrive _______ to get a good seat.",
    options: ["on time", "in time"],
    correctAnswer: "in time",
    explanation: "The goal here is not just to be punctual for the start time ('on time') but to arrive early enough for a specific purpose (getting a good seat). This concept of having sufficient spare time for an activity is perfectly captured by 'in time'."
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    text: "He considered several career pathsâ€”medicine, law, and engineering. _______, he decided to become a teacher, which truly made him happy.",
    options: ["At the end", "In the end"],
    correctAnswer: "in the end",
    explanation: "This sentence describes a decision-making process over time. 'In the end' is used to signify the final outcome or conclusion of this process. It means 'eventually' or 'after much consideration'. 'At the end' would be incorrect as it doesn't refer to the final point of a specific, tangible event or object."
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    text: "Please submit your expense reports _______ of the fiscal month; any reports submitted after that will be processed in the next cycle.",
    options: ["at the end", "in the end"],
    correctAnswer: "at the end",
    explanation: "'At the end of...' is used to specify a point in time. 'The fiscal month' is a defined period, and 'at the end of' refers to the final part of it. 'In the end' would imply a concluding result, which doesn't fit the context of a simple deadline."
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    text: "The concert was scheduled to start at 8:00 PM. The band walked on stage _______ and played for three hours.",
    options: ["on time", "in time"],
    correctAnswer: "on time",
    explanation: "The sentence refers to a scheduled event (the concert start time). Arriving punctually for a schedule is described by 'on time'. There is no sense of urgency or 'just before it was too late,' so 'in time' is less appropriate."

            <p class="mb-3 text-muted-foreground">Think of 'On time' as hitting a specific point on a timeline. 'In time' is about arriving within a window of opportunity before it closes.</p>

                <strong class="text-sky-600">On time</strong>: Punctual, not late. It relates to a pre-arranged schedule or appointment. The focus is on precision.
                <br>
                <em>Example: "The meeting is at 2:00 PM. Please be <span class="font-semibold">on time</span>." (Meaning: Arrive at 2:00 PM exactly, not after.)</em>

                <strong class="text-teal-600">In time (for something / to do something)</strong>: Soon enough. You have enough time to spare before it's too late. The focus is on opportunity.
                <br>
                <em>Example: "We arrived <span class="font-semibold">in time</span> to catch the last train." (Meaning: We arrived before the train left; we didn't miss our chance.)</em>
