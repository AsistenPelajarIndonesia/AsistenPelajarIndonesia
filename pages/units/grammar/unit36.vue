      { text: "Can you help me?", value: "a" },
      { text: "Excuse me, could you possibly help me for a moment?", value: "b" },

      { text: "Help me.", value: "d" }
    ],
    userAnswer: null,
    correctAnswer: "b",
    explanation: "`Could you possibly...?` is the most polite and tentative form, suitable for a formal, quiet environment. 'Can you...?' is too direct. 'Would you like to...?' is an offer/invitation, which doesn't fit the context. 'Help me' is an impolite command."
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    context: "You want to offer your elderly neighbour a ride to the supermarket. What do you say?",
    question: "You say:",

      { text: "Could I give you a lift?", value: "d" }
    ],
    userAnswer: null,
    correctAnswer: "c",
    explanation: "`Would you like...?` is the classic, polite structure for offers and invitations. 'Can you...?' is a request, not an offer. 'Would you mind...?' is a request and sounds awkward here. 'Could I...?' is asking for permission for yourself, which is not the intention."
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    type: 'error-correction',
    context: "A colleague is struggling with a heavy box. You want to offer help. Identify the grammatically incorrect offer:",
    question: "Which sentence is WRONG?",

      { text: "Would you mind to help you?", value: "d" }
    ],
    userAnswer: null,
    correctAnswer: "d",
    explanation: "The phrase `Would you mind...?` is used for polite requests, not offers. Furthermore, it must be followed by an `-ing` verb (e.g., 'Would you mind helping me?'). The other options are all correct ways to offer assistance."

      { text: "Making a formal invitation.", value: "d" }
    ],
    userAnswer: null,
    correctAnswer: "c",
    explanation: "`Could I...?` is a polite form used to ask for permission to do something yourself. The speaker is not asking the manager to do something (a request), nor are they offering or inviting. The word 'perhaps' further emphasizes the tentative, polite nature of the permission-seeking."
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    context: "You are having dinner at a friend's house. Your friend asks you:",
    question: "'______ you pass the salt, please?' - Which word is LEAST likely to be used by your friend?",

      { text: "Would", value: "c" }
    ],
    userAnswer: null,
    correctAnswer: "c",
    explanation: "For requests, both `Can` (informal) and `Could` (more polite) are very common. `Would you pass...?` is grammatically possible but much less common for this type of simple request than `Can` or `Could`. `Would you mind passing...?` would be a very polite alternative. The most common structure with `Would` for a request is `Would you be so kind as to pass...`, which is very formal."
