    questionText: "Your friend Sarah is a musician. You see her with a violin, which is unusual. You ask:",
    options: [
      { id: 'q1o1', value: "How long have you been playing the violin?", label: "How long have you been playing the violin?" },
      { id: 'q1o2', value: "How long have you played the violin?", label: "How long have you played the violin?" },
      { id: 'q1o3', value: "How long are you playing the violin?", label: "How long are you playing the violin?" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "How long have you been playing the violin?",
    explanation: "The Present Perfect Continuous ('have been playing') is ideal here. It emphasizes the ongoing, potentially recent, activity of playing. While 'have played' is not strictly incorrect, it is less common for this type of question about an active skill. The focus is on the continuous action rather than a completed achievement. 'Are you playing' is Present Continuous for actions happening *right now* or in the near future, not for duration from the past until now."
  },
  {
    id: 'q2',
    questionText: "Mark and Lisa got married in 2010. It is now 2024. Which sentence is the most natural and grammatically correct?",
    options: [
      { id: 'q2o1', value: "They have been being married for 14 years.", label: "They have been being married for 14 years." },
      { id: 'q2o2', value: "They are married for 14 years.", label: "They are married for 14 years." },
      { id: 'q2o3', value: "They have been married for 14 years.", label: "They have been married for 14 years." },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "They have been married for 14 years.",
    explanation: "This question tests your knowledge of 'stative' verbs. 'To be' (in the state of being married) is a stative verb, not an action verb. We do not use continuous tenses with stative verbs. Therefore, the Present Perfect Simple ('have been married') is the only correct choice to express a state that began in the past and continues to the present. 'Have been being' is grammatically incorrect and unnatural."
  },
  {
    id: 'q3',
    questionText: "A programmer is talking about her current project. She wants to emphasize the continuous effort and the fact that the work is not yet finished. What does she say?",
    options: [
      { id: 'q3o1', value: "I have been writing this code all week.", label: "I have been writing this code all week." },
      { id: 'q3o2', value: "I have written this code all week.", label: "I have written this code all week." },
      { id: 'q3o3', value: "I wrote this code all week.", label: "I wrote this code all week." },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "I have been writing this code all week.",
    explanation: "The key here is the desire to 'emphasize the continuous effort' on an 'unfinished' task. The Present Perfect Continuous ('have been writing') perfectly captures this nuance. It focuses on the activity and its duration. 'I have written...' suggests the task might be complete, focusing on the result. 'I wrote...' is Past Simple, implying the week is finished, which contradicts the context of an ongoing project."
  },
  {
    id: 'q4',
    questionText: "You notice your brother hasn't touched his new gaming console. You ask him about it. Which question is correct?",
    options: [
      { id: 'q4o1', value: "How long haven't you been playing it?", label: "How long haven't you been playing it?" },
      { id: 'q4o2', value: "How long haven't you played it?", label: "How long haven't you played it?" },
      { id: 'q4o3', value: "How long it's been since you played it?", label: "How long it's been since you played it?" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "How long haven't you played it?",
    explanation: "Negative questions about duration are tricky. We typically use the Present Perfect Simple in the negative form ('haven't played') to ask about a period of non-activity. 'Haven't you been playing' is awkward and rarely used. A more natural alternative is 'How long has it been since you played it?', but the option provided has incorrect word order ('it's been' instead of 'has it been'). Therefore, 'How long haven't you played it?' is the best choice among the given options for a direct negative question."
  },
  {
    id: 'q5',
    questionText: "Situation: You meet a friend who is a successful author. You want to ask about the total number of books she has produced in her career. You ask:",
    options: [
      { id: 'q5o1', value: "How many books have you been writing?", label: "How many books have you been writing?" },
      { id: 'q5o2', value: "How many books have you written?", label: "How many books have you written?" },
      { id: 'q5o3', value: "How long have you written books?", label: "How long have you written books?" },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "How many books have you written?",
    explanation: "This question hinges on the distinction between duration ('how long') and quantity ('how many'). When we ask about the result or the completed number of items, we must use the Present Perfect Simple ('have you written'). 'Have you been writing' focuses on the recent, ongoing activity of writing, not the total produced. 'How long have you written' is grammatically awkward; we would say 'How long have you been writing books?' to ask about the duration of the career, not the quantity produced."
  },
  {
    id: 'q6',
    questionText: "Your boss asks for a project update. You have been working on a financial report nonstop since Monday and you are exhausted, but you also want to report that you have finished three out of five sections. Which statement best communicates BOTH the continuous effort and a partial result?",
    options: [
      { id: 'q6o1', value: "I have finished three sections, but I am still working.", label: "I have finished three sections, but I am still working." },
      { id: 'q6o2', value: "I have been working on this report all week, and so far I have finished three sections.", label: "I have been working on this report all week, and so far I have finished three sections." },
      { id: 'q6o3', value: "I have been finishing three sections of this report all week.", label: "I have been finishing three sections of this report all week." },
    ],
    correctAnswer: "I have been working on this report all week, and so far I have finished three sections.",
    explanation: "This is an advanced application where both tenses are used together to convey a complete picture. 'I have been working...' (Present Perfect Continuous) perfectly describes the uninterrupted, ongoing effort. '...I have finished...' (Present Perfect Simple) clearly states the completed result or achievement so far. Option 1 is too simplistic. Option 3 is incorrect because 'finish' is a verb that describes a moment of completion, not a continuous activity, so 'have been finishing' is unnatural in this context."
