  {
    id: 1,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    text: "The business was failing. ____ day brought fresh anxieties and fewer customers.",
    prompt: "Choose the word that emphasizes the continuous, uninterrupted sequence of days.",
    options: ['Each', 'Every'],
    correctAnswer: 'Every',
    explanation: "We use 'every' to talk about things that happen repeatedly or at regular intervals (every day, every week). It emphasizes the collective sequence of events, painting a picture of relentless, daily decline."
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    text: "The detective interviewed the five witnesses and gave ____ of them a chance to tell their story.",
    prompt: "Which word is required when followed by 'of the' to refer to members of a specific, defined group?",
    options: ['Each', 'Every'],
    correctAnswer: 'Each',
    explanation: "A critical rule: 'every' cannot be directly followed by 'of'. When referring to an individual member of a specific group (like 'the five witnesses'), you must use 'each of'. 'Every one of' is a possible alternative, but 'each of' is more common and direct."
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    text: "Holding a trophy in ____ hand, the champion beamed at the crowd.",
    prompt: "Select the only possible word when referring to a set of two.",
    options: ['Each', 'Every'],
    correctAnswer: 'Each',
    explanation: "'Each' can be used for two or more items, but 'every' must be used for three or more. Since a person has only two hands, 'each' is the only correct choice. Think of it as focusing on the individual items in a small, countable set."
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    text: "____ seat in the massive stadium, which holds 80,000 people, was sold out.",
    prompt: "Which word is more natural for describing a large, almost indefinite number of items within a group?",
    options: ['Each', 'Every'],
    correctAnswer: 'Every',
    explanation: "While 'each' is not grammatically wrong here, 'every' is far more natural and idiomatic when talking about large numbers. 'Every' treats the items as a collective group ('all the seats'), while 'each' would imply an unnatural focus on seat 1, seat 2, seat 3, and so on."
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    text: "The tour guide gave the tourists a map. ____ was advised to keep it safe.",
    prompt: "Which word can function as a standalone pronoun?",
    options: ['Each', 'Every'],
    correctAnswer: 'Each',
    explanation: "'Each' can stand alone as a pronoun. 'Every' cannot; it must always be followed by a noun (every person) or use a compound form like 'everyone' or 'everybody'. Here, 'Each' is a pronoun referring back to 'each tourist'."
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    text: "I get my car serviced ____ six months without fail.",
    prompt: "Choose the word used to denote regular, recurring intervals.",
    options: ['each', 'every'],
    correctAnswer: 'every',
    explanation: "'Every' is the standard choice for expressing frequency (every ten minutes, every three weeks). It signals a regular, repeating pattern. 'Each six months' is not idiomatic in this context."
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    text: "He carefully examined the paintings. He spent ten minutes on ____ one.",
    prompt: "Which option correctly completes the phrase that emphasizes individual consideration?",
    options: ['each', 'every'],
    correctAnswer: 'each',
    explanation: "The phrase 'each one' is used to emphasize individuality and separate action. While 'every one' exists, 'each one' is more common for highlighting the distinct, item-by-item focus, which fits the context of careful examination."
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    type: 'multiple-choice',
    text: "The concert tickets were expensive, costing over Â£100 ____.",
    prompt: "Select the word that can be used adverbially at the end of a phrase to mean 'per item'.",
    options: ['each', 'every'],
    correctAnswer: 'each',
    explanation: "Only 'each' can be used as an adverb in this way, typically after a price or quantity, to mean 'for one item'. You can say 'The apples are 50p each', but not '50p every'."

          <CardTitle>Core Principle: Singular Focus</CardTitle>
          <CardDescription>
            Both 'each' and 'every' are followed by a singular countable noun and a singular verb.
            This is the foundational rule that trips up many learners.

          <CardTitle>Key Differences: When to Use Which</CardTitle>
          <CardDescription>
            The choice between 'each' and 'every' depends on perspective: are you seeing a group or its individuals?

            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-1 text-sm text-muted-foreground">
              <li><strong>Each:</strong> Use for a small, specific number of items. It emphasizes the individuality of each member. Think of a one-by-one action. <br><em>Example: She kissed <strong>each</strong> of her two children on the forehead.</em></li>
              <li><strong>Every:</strong> Use for a large, general, or indefinite number. It emphasizes the collective whole; all members are included. <br><em>Example: <strong>Every</strong> citizen has the right to vote.</em></li>

              <li><strong>Each:</strong> Can be followed by 'of' when referring to a specific, definite group (usually preceded by 'the', 'my', 'these'). <br><em>Example: <strong>Each of</strong> the team members received a medal.</em></li>
              <li><strong>Every:</strong> Cannot be used with 'of'. You must use "every one of". <br><em>Example: <strong>Every one of</strong> the paintings was a masterpiece.</em></li>

              <li><strong>Each:</strong> Can function as a pronoun on its own. <br><em>Example: Two books were offered. He took <strong>each</strong>.</em></li>
              <li><strong>Every:</strong> Cannot function as a pronoun. It must modify a noun. Use 'everyone' or 'everybody' instead. <br><em>Example: <del>He greeted every.</del> He greeted <strong>everyone</strong>.</em></li>
