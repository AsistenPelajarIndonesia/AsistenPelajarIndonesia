    explanation: "We use the Present Perfect Continuous to ask about a recent activity that has a clear result in the present (being out of breath). The focus is on the action of running itself, not its completion.",
    hint: "Think about an action that just finished and has a present result."

    userAnswer: '',
    correctAnswer: ['has been working'],
    explanation: "This tense is perfect for describing a temporary but intense period of activity that has led to a present state (exhaustion). 'For the past two weeks' highlights the duration.",

    correctAnswer: ['has been trying'],
